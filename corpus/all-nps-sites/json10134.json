NPS Photo  The Scale House, built in 1829, was used as a storage facility for the scales and other equipment required to weigh cargo that was unloaded from a ship.

There, the goods were weighed and measured, and later duties were assessed on the cargo.  \u00a0   For More Information: The Salem Custom House The U.S. Custom Service in Salem Issues of our occasional publication, Pickled Fish and Salted Provisions \u201cA Large Scale Enterprise\u201d Volume 4, Number 1 (143 KB pdf files)", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/sama/learn/historyculture/scalehouse.htm", "title": "Salem Maritime National Historic Site: Scale House"}
