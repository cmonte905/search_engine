NPS photo  Latest News of the Friendship of Salem The Friendship of Salem left Derby Wharf for a scheduled \u201chaul-out\u201d on July 5, 2016. A haul-out is where a ship is removed from the water to perform inspections, repairs and routine maintenance that are only possible when the vessel is out of the water. Friendship of Salem will be repaired by Boothbay Harbor Shipyard and Gloucester Marine Railways Corporation on Rocky Neck in Gloucester, Massachusetts. When all inspections and repairs are complete she will return. The purpose of the estimated 12 week contract is to perform a variety of maintenance, inspection and repair work including:   \u2022 Cleaning, inspection, repairs, and painting of the hull below the waterline;    \u2022 Painting of portions of the hull and attachments above the waterline;    \u2022 Inspection, cleaning and maintenance on propellers, shafts, rudder and other running gear components; and,    \u2022 Repair of a deteriorated hull section on starboard side near the base of the foremast.   We hope that the Friendship will return to Derby Wharf by November 2016. For more information please visit our Facebook page.   The Salem East Indiaman Friendship was launched in 1797. She made 15 voyages during her career to Batavia, India, China, South America, the Caribbean, England, Germany, the Mediterranean, and Russia. Built for the Salem mercantile firm Waite and Peirce in the South River shipyard of Enos Briggs, she ended her activities as an American merchant vessel when she was captured as a prize of war by the British Sloop of War HMS Rosamond in September 1812. The replica of Friendship was built by the National Park Service using modern materials and construction methods while retaining the appearance of the original ship.   \u00a0     Sea chests were used by both officers and sailors as secure places to store their personal belongings. NPS photo  The Crew of an East Indiaman The captain, or master, of a vessel had absolute power of command aboard ship. He was legally accountable for every aspect of the operation of the ship, the activities of her crew and the safe delivery of all cargo entrusted to his care. The great cabin, located at the stern of the ship, was the captain's private space, office and dining room.  \u00a0     The forecastle (or fo'c'sle) was the sailor's quarters. NPS photo  Aboard merchant and whaling ships, bunks were provided for the crew in the living area called the forecastle in the bow of the ship. Although damp, poorly ventilated and sometimes stifling or freezing, the arrangement was more comfortable than the hammocks and overcrowded conditions aboard naval vessels.  \u00a0   For more information: Download the Friendship of Salem site bulletin (128 KB pdf file) Issues of Salem Maritime\u2019s occasional newsletter, Pickled Fish and Salted Provisions \u201cPartners for Eternity\u201d Volume 1, Number 7 (125 KB pdf file) \u201cFigureheads\u201d Volume 2, Number 3 (89 KB pdf file) \u201cTall Ships, Small Ships\u201d Volume 2, Number 5 (70 KB pdf file) \u201cSeaman's Clothing in Friendship's Era\u201d Volume 3, Number 2 (113 KB pdf file) \u201cShoes, Ships, and Survival\u201d Volume 3, Number 3 (379 KB pdf file) \u201cRepeat Performance\u201d Volume 3, Number 4 (coming soon) \u201cRats\u201d Volume 3, Number 5 (coming soon) \u201cFire and Lights\u201d Volume 3, Number 6 (127 KB pdf file) \u201cMary's Little Lamb\u201d Volume 4, Number 3 (coming soon) \u201cWalk Away With the Cat, Walk Away With the Fish\u201d Volume 4, Number 4 (331 KB pdf file) \u201cThe Medicine Chest\u201d Volume 6, Number 3 (228 KB pdf file) \u201cThe Arms Chest\u201d Volume 7, Number 1 (136 KB pdf file) \u201cThe Great Age of Duck\u201d Volume 7, Number 4 (916 KB pdf file) \u201cWhat's In a Name?\u201d Volume 8, Number 3 (539 KB pdf file) \u201cAre We There Yet?\u201d Volume 8, Number 4 (798 KB pdf file) \u201cA Salem Clipper\u201d Volume 8, Number 5 (4.8 M pdf file) \u201cWhat Ship is That?\u201d Volume 8, Number 6 (762 KB pdf file)", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/sama/learn/historyculture/friendshiphistory.htm", "title": "Salem Maritime National Historic Site: Friendship of Salem"}
