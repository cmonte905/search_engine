{"body": "Be A Junior Ranger          What is a junior ranger? A junior ranger attends ranger programs, completes activities in a workbook, and promises to take care of Boston Harbor Islands. It is a great way to learn and have fun in the park. When you are a junior ranger, you can teach others how to care for nature.  How do you become a junior ranger? Before your arrival to the park, download the Junior Ranger booklet of your choice and bring it to the islands. Complete activities in the booklet and attend a ranger program. Then, take the completed booklet to any Boston Harbor Islands park ranger who will check your answers, sign your booklet, and give you an official Boston Harbor Islands Junior Ranger badge. You can take it home and show all your friends. Collect them all! What activities can you do at home?
