{"body": "Longfellow and the Fugitive Slave Act         Henry W. Longfellow, by S. Laurence, 1854.   Longfellow's Outrage at the Fugitive Slave Act The passage of the Fugitive Slave Act in 1850 enraged Northern whites, and turned even moderates into activists. It deeply affected Henry Longfellow and his close friends, among them Charles Sumner and Richard Henry Dana Jr. This federal law required residents in free states to aid in arresting runaway slaves. Those who helped escaped slaves faced a $1000 fine, six months in jail, and possible charges of treason. The law also established a separate legal system to process accused fugitives. Both free blacks and former slaves fled their homes since they had no legal right to plead their cases under the Fugitive Slave Act. Abolitionists and ordinary citizens organized committees, raised funds, and assisted the Underground Railroad. Boston emerged as a center for resistance to this law. Longfellow wrote of his meeting the escaped slave Ellen Craft. Passing for a white man, she had traveled north to freedom with her husband pretending to be her slave. On February 12, 1850, Henry recorded in his journal: \u201cWent to Miss Bremer\u2019s\u2026. While I was there, Ellen Craft came in,\u2013 the slave woman who ran away disguised in man\u2019s clothes as a young master, her husband going as her slave. When Miss Bremer told me who it was, and spoke of man\u2019s clothes, Ellen hung her head and said she did not like it mentioned,\u2013 and \u2018some people thought it shocking.\u2019 Miss Bremer laughed at this prudery, as well she might; and we both urged her to be proud of the act.\u201d Longfellow\u2019s journals show that he had carefully tracked several of the fugitive slave cases in Boston and decried the city for its tolerance of such injustices. On October 26, 1850, he railed: \u201cThe slave-hunters are in Boston. I hope they will be imprisoned, as they deserve. What a disgrace this is to a republic of the nineteenth century.\u201d On October 27, 1850, he noted: \u201cSumner at dinner. The Fugitive Slave, Craft, has got a warrant against his pursuers, and had them arrested for slander in calling him a thief, the damages laid at ten thousand dollars. They found bail. This is a good beginning. I hear they will be drummed out of town.\u201d And on February 15, 1851: \u201cA fugitive slave, or a man accused of being one, escaped today from the court room during the recess, aided by other blacks. Very glad of it. This government must not pass laws that outrage the sense of right in the community.\u201d On April 4, 1851, he wrote: \u201cThere is much excitement in Boston about the capture of an alleged fugitive slave. O city without soul! When and where will this end? Shame, that the great Republic, the \u2018refuge of the oppressed,\u2019 should stoop so low as to become the Hunter of Slaves!\u201d Two days later Longfellow remarked: \u201cSumner came not withstanding the rain. He says that Charles G. Loring is to defend the fugitive Simms [sic]. They want to get a chance to argue the constitutionality of this infamous Fugitive Slave Law.\u201d On April 29, 1854, Longfellow cheered his friend on: \u201cSumner is still going from town to town stirring the hearts of men with his noble words on Slavery. God speed him.\u201d In a letter to Charles Sumner, June 2, 1854, Longfellow praised him and the work of their mutual friend Dana: \u201cTo-day is decided the fate of Burns, the fugitive slave. You have read it all in the papers\u2014the arrest, the trial, etc. Dana has done nobly; acting throughout with the greatest nerve and intrepidity. Fanny joins me in congratulations on your noble position and labors. It is a great thing in one\u2019s life to stand so long and unflinching in the range of the enemy\u2019s artillery.\u201d After the Fugitive Slave Act was passed, Longfellow\u2019s account books report numerous donations throughout the 1850s given directly to free or educate individual slaves and their children. They also include entries for contributions to organizations and schools to help freedom seekers, and to those offering them shelter. Dozens of entries show that Longfellow gave amounts ranging from $2 to $50, roughly equivalent to $48 to $1200 today. On at least two occasions Longfellow contributed $10 to Mary Elizabeth Wormeley, who raised money to buy the freedom of slaves. On July 29, 1853, he wrote to her: \u201cI am ashamed to send you so small a sum as the inclosed for an emergency so great as the one you mention. If necessary I will double the amount; and if time presses, and donors reluctant, be kind enough to let me know it. I am very glad you have undertaken this business. I am sure you will carry it through triumphantly; and the bitterness of begging will be lost in the sweetness of giving.\u201d Three days later she responded that she had received from many people a total of $1,441. \u201cI shall free Evelina and her younger children and Sarah\u2019s husband,\u201d she said. \u201cThree of John Gorden\u2019s children will be left behind. May the Father of the fatherless save them from the fate hanging over them.\u201d In June 1857 Longfellow\u2019s account book shows that he gave \u201cMrs. Hillard for Slaves $5.00.\u201d It was well known that Susan Hillard, wife of Henry\u2019s long-time friend George Stillman Hillard, secreted fugitive slaves in the attic of her house on Beacon Hill. Longfellow surely knew this and supported her efforts with a monetary donation. Mr. Hillard was a United States commissioner whose business it was to issue warrants to marshals for the capture of runaway slaves. Their neighbor, Rev. James Freeman Clarke, believed that Mr. Hillard knew of his wife\u2019s concealment of slaves but never interfered. Longfellow longed for an end to the law. His June 29, 1854, journal entry read: \u201cNews from Washington of a fierce debate in Congress on a repeal of the Fugitive Slave Law, in which Sumner takes a conspicuous part, and does himself much honor.\u201d  Longfellow summed up his attitude towards the Fugitive Slave Law in his journal on April 29,1858: \u201cDine with the Club. Felt vexed at seeing plover on the table this season, and proclaimed aloud my disgust at seeing the game-laws thus violated. If anybody wants to break a law, let him break the Fugitive Slave Law. That is all it is fit for.\u201d By December 2, 1859, Longfellow saw a brighter future: \u201cThis will be a great day in our history; the date of a new Revolution,\u2013 quite as much needed as the old one. Even now as I write, they are leading Old John Brown to execution in Virginia for attempting to rescue slaves! This is sowing the wind to reap the whirlwind, which will come soon.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/long/learn/historyculture/henry-wadsworth-longfellow-abolitionist.htm", "title": "Longfellow House Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site: Longfellow and the Fugitive Slave Act"}
