{"body": "Boston Massacre Trial         John Adams Photo Courtesy of Independence National Historical Park  The crowd strained forward in the Queen Street courtroom on October 17, 1770. Murmurs and rumblings of anger filled the air. Captain Thomas Preston, a British grenadier, shifted his feet nervously and felt the sweat rising to his brow. If the jury found him, and his men, guilty of murder as the indictment suggested, he could only expect death as a penalty. That is what these Bostonians wanted! The only hope for Preston and his men lay with this short, stocky country lawyer\u2014a colonial American after all\u2014John Adams, and his too young assistant Josiah Quincy. Seven months had passed since the \u201chorrid, bloody massacre\u201d took place on the 5th of March. But the passions of the people remained strong. \u201cSons of Liberty\u201d such as Samuel Adams and John Hancock had seen to that! They reminded the good citizens that the British soldiers were not welcomed, and that mobs had as much right to carry clubs as the soldiers had to carry loaded muskets! But now the jury was set and the true drama was beginning. Only a fair trial would show the world that Massachusetts, and by association all Americans, deserved their liberty by an appeal to justice and not by the rule of a mob. Captain Preston had his doubts that a fair trial was possible. Yet there was something about his lawyer that gave him hope. This fellow Adams\u2014colonial though he was\u2014was tenacious when it came to the truth, braver than most when it came to risking himself or his family, devoted beyond reason when it came to the law, and undeniably intelligent. If anyone could help these hapless soldiers in a foreign land, Preston thought, Adams seemed the man. The lawyer hardly cut a gallant figure standing before the bar wearing the powdered wig and black robe of His Majesty\u2019s court. Yet there was something\u2026   Adams seemed at home in the courtroom, like an experienced mariner navigating the shoals of a dangerous coastline. He had been able to impanel a jury from out-of-town, not a single Boston man among them and, Preston felt, the jury seemed uncommonly thoughtful for upstart colonials! Now Adams was questioning Richard Palmes, a witness most of the crowd recognized, about events that night. Preston could hear Palmes saying,   \u201cThat instant\u2026I saw something resembling Snow or Ice strike the Grenadier on the Captain\u2019s right hand\u2026He [the Grenadier] fired the first Gun. After the Gun went off I heard the word \u2018fire!\u2019 The Captain and I stood in front about half between the breech and muzzle of the Guns. I don\u2019t know who gave the word to fire.\u201d    Adams let Palmes\u2019 words settle like fallen snow on the minds of the jury. Who could say where the command \u201cfire\u201d had come from? Many in the mob had been yelling \u201cfire, damn you\u2026ye\u2019 dare not!\u201d Clubs and chunks of ice had been ready in menacing hands! What reasonable man, or even seasoned soldier, would not fear for his life? \u201cMalice aforethought\u201d is what the indictment had charged. Yet Adams was showing that confusion, terror, and even curiosity were more on the minds of everyone that night in  King Street  . Even the jury\u2019s faces showed the common truth of this.  John Adams was in his element! Like a gladiator he loved the arena where great battles were fought! For Adams, a man\u2019s character was not measured by the popularity he inspired in his neighbors, but by the \u201ctruth\u201d he pursued. As he would say in a letter to his beloved Abigail, \u201cI\u2026have consented to my own ruin, to your ruin, and to the ruin of our children.\u201d But he would also assert \u201cthe law\u2026will not bend to the uncertain wishes, imaginations, and wanton tempers of men.\u201d When the jury quickly returned with a \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict against Preston, Adams felt a great weight lifted from his shoulders. Soon after, the trial of the other eight men\u2014Hugh White, Hugh Montgomery, Matthew Kilroy, John Carroll, James Hartigan, William McCauley, William Warren, and William Wemms\u2014began. By now, Captain Preston had great admiration for their lawyer\u2019s abilities. Generally, Preston resented these colonials and felt that \u201cmalcontents\u201d were \u201cusing every method to fish out evidence to prove [the shooting] was a concerted scheme to murder the inhabitants.\u201d But if a British soldier could be acquitted by a New England jury, perhaps there was more, he thought! Following one of the first trials in American history to last for several days, even the frenetic crowd seemed exhausted. Testimony after testimony had been used to show both sides of the \u201cmassacre\u201d story. But as Adams said in his summary, \u201cfacts are stubborn things\u2026if they [the soldiers] were assaulted at all\u2026this was a provocation for which the law reduces the offense of killing, down to manslaughter\u2026\u201d In less than three hours, the jury reached a verdict. No malice was found. All eight men were found not guilty of murder. Two, Hugh Montgomery and Matthew Kilroy, were found guilty of manslaughter. A defense lawyer to the last, Adams negotiated the sentences of Montgomery and Kilroy using and ancient precedent of English law. The \u201cPlea of Clergy\u201d meant that instead of death, the two men would be branded on the thumbs as first offenders, never to be permitted to violate the law again. Adams would later describe his role as \u201cthe greatest service I ever rendered my country.\u201d Why? In a town where British soldiers were hated, there had been a fair trial by jury. In a land where mobs could sway events, the world saw that justice and liberty were valued as the legal rights of all!", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/bost/learn/historyculture/massacre-trial.htm", "title": "Boston National Historical Park: Boston Massacre Trial"}
