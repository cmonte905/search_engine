On most days, the strong trade winds make it easy to see how the cone was built during the high lava fountaining in 1959. Notice parts of the old road are buried under Pu\u02bbu Pua\u02bbi. (Road rebuilding and rerouting is a fact of life here at Hawai\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park.) Close to K\u012blauea Iki\u02bbs fountaining, the lava pumice cinders were hot enough to weld themselves together into a spatter cone, Pu\u02bbu Pua\u02bbi. Pu\u02bbu Pua\u02bbi means gushing hill. Further downwind, the falling cinders had cooled sufficiently to form a blanket of cinders. The Pu'u Pua'i overlook area is also the upper trailhead for Devastation Trail, which provides a full view of the spatter cone.  \u00a0   Go to: Crater Rim Drive Tour - Stop #8 - Devastation Trail  \u00a0   Return to: Crater Rim Drive Tour - main page Things to Do", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/havo/planyourvisit/craterrimtour_puupuai.htm", "title": "Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park: Pu\u2018u Pua\u2018i Overlook"}
