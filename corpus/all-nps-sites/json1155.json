Alternately, the driver could drive to the Overlook and the rest of the party could walk a 1/2 mile section of the Crater Rim Trail to the Overlook. This is also an option when the Thurston Lava Tube parking area is full. K\u012blauea Iki looks fairly tranquil these days. But, in 1959 it was a seething lava lake, with lava fountains up to 1,900 feet. From up here it is difficult to comprehend the scale of K\u012blauea Iki. The crater is a mile long, 3,000 feet across, and the floor is 400 feet below the overlook. This is the trailhead for the 4 mile loop hike around K\u012blauea Iki.  \u00a0   Go to: Crater Rim Drive Tour - Stop #6 - N\u0101huku : Thurston Lava Tube  \u00a0   Return to: Crater Rim Drive Tour - main page Things to Do", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/havo/planyourvisit/craterrimtour_kilaueaikiovlk.htm", "title": "Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park: K\u012blauea Iki Overlook"}
