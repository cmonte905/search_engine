The K\u012blauea Overlook is located on the left side of the road, approximately .7 miles from Steaming Bluffs. The road sign indicates that this a picnic area. Which it is, but it is also a splendid overlook of the K\u012blauea Caldera and Halema'uma'u Crater. The view here is similar to that found at the Jaggar Museum, but is usually much less crowded. And, it is a nice place for a picnic. The view of K\u012blauea caldera from this overlook is spectacular. The caldera (a very large crater formed by collapse) is about 2 miles wide and more than 3 miles long. The highest point on the caldera's edge is near K\u012blauea Overlook. Halema'uma'u, the main pit crater within K\u012blauea caldera, is very visible from this point.  \u00a0   Go to: Crater Rim Drive Tour - Stop #4 - Steam Vents, Steaming Bluff and Ha'akulamanu - Sulphur Banks  \u00a0   Return to: Crater Rim Drive Tour - main page Things to Do", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/havo/planyourvisit/craterrimtour_kilaueaovrlk.htm", "title": "Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park: K\u012blauea Overlook"}
