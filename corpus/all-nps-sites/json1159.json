{"body": "Jaggar Museum       Crater Rim Drive Tour - Stop #2  \u00a0    Overlook at Jaggar Museum NPS - Ed Shiinoki   \u00a0     The fuming vent in Halema`uma`u crater is best viewed from the Jaggar Museum overlook. NPS Photo by N. Judd 04/18/08  Your next stop on the Crater Rim Drive Tour will be Jaggar Museum (the next left turn after leaving K\u012blauea Overlook). This is one of the busiest locations in the park. Be careful when parking. Look out for n\u0113n\u0113, the endangered Hawaiian goose. The Thomas A. Jaggar Museum is a museum on volcanology with displays of equipment used by scientists in the past to study the volcano, working seismographs, and an exhibit of clothing and gear from scientists who got a bit too close to lava. There is also a gift shop with books, videos, cds, maps, and other special items for sale. The Museum has large windows which affords a sheltered view of the caldera and main crater, Halema'uma'u, when weather is inclement. The overlook outside the building offers an incredible view of the volcano with interpretive displays about K\u012blauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes. The US Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory is adjoining the Jaggar Museum. It is not open to the public.   \u00a0   For more information about Jaggar Museum, please visit the \"Jaggar Museum & Halema'uma'u Overlook\" page.  \u00a0   Note: A portion of Crater Rim Drive, between Jaggar Museum and the Chain of Craters Road junction is closed indefinitely due to the fumes and ashfall from the vent that opened within Halema\u02bbuma\u02bbu Crater in March 2008. The section of Crater Rim Drive from Chain of Craters Road to Keanak\u0101ko'i Crater is open to foot traffic.  \u00a0   Go to: Crater Rim Drive Tour - Stop #3 - K\u012blauea Overlook  \u00a0   Return to: Crater Rim Drive Tour - main page Things to Do", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/havo/planyourvisit/craterrimtour_jaggar.htm", "title": "Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park: Jaggar Museum"}
