{"body": "N\u0101pau       The N\u0101pau Trail and Na\u02bbulu Trail are open, however, due to the extreme instability of the area they are subject to closure at any time. Everyone who plans to hike the N\u0101pau Trail past Pu\u02bbu Huluhulu OR the N\u0101ulu Trail must self-register at the hiker's check-in station located at the trailhead or on the trail just past the trailhead at Kealakomo.  (see Area Closures and Advisories)  \u00a0       Hikers enjoy the beauty of the lava landscape near Makaopuhi Crater NPS photo by Norrie Judd  Following the East Rift Zone of K\u012blauea, the N\u0101pau Trail provides opportunities for hikers to experience a diversity of environments in Hawai\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park. The 14 mile round trip (7 + hours) hike is through varied terrain ranging from recent lava flows to dense tree fern rain forests. Begin this hike from the Mauna Ulu parking area, 3 1/2 miles down the Chain of Craters Road. Your destination is N\u0101pau Crater where hikers may gaze at Pu\u02bbu \u02bb\u014c\u02bb\u014d vent steaming and fuming in the distance. There is a campground and pit toilet at the end of the trail. Overnight camping is currently permitted, however this status may change depending on volcanic activity. Contact the Backcountry Permit office at (808) 985-6178 for current camping information.  \u00a0   The N\u0101pau Trail passes through lava flows from the Mauna Ulu eruptions. Mauna Ulu (Lit. growing mountain), a recently formed shield volcano, erupted from 1969 through 1974 leaving an altered landscape of incredibly fascinating geologic features. Trekking over lava rivers and through lava channels, appreciating the fragile beauty of lava trees, peering into pit craters, and imagining a time when molten rock once sloshed like water in a perched lava pond, hikers will find that this trail offers an experience for all to enjoy.  \u00a0   Hiking Tips (pdf-217KB) Please view this four minute video - \"Plan for Safe Viewing of Lava Flows\"  \u00a0   Trailheads No drinking water is available at the trailheads or anywhere along the N\u0101pau, Naulu, and Kalapana Trails. We do not have streams in this area so backpackers must bring in all their own water (recommended: 4 quarts/person/day). The N\u0101pau Trail begins at the Mauna Ulu parking area (approx. 3.5 miles down the Chain of Craters Road). The Naulu Trail, which links to the N\u0101pau Trail, begins at the Kealakomo parking area (approx. 9.7 miles down the Chain of Craters Road). Neither trailhead has public telephones or public transportation. It takes about 20 to 30 minutes to drive from the K\u012blauea Visitor Center via Crater Rim Drive and Chain of Craters Road to get to the trailheads. The lower end of the historic Kalapana trail has been covered by miles of lava.The upper section of the trail is no longer maintained, densely overgrown and is extremely difficult to follow. DO NOT plan on using this trail.  \u00a0   Trail Conditions Hiking over rocky terrain is strenuous. Hiking boots provide the best traction and protection when hiking on lava. Long pants afford some protection if one should fall on the sharp, glassy lava. The N\u0101pau and Naulu trails traverse over rough, unstable \u02bba\u02bba and pahoehoe lava. There may be only a 200' elevation change on the N\u0101pau Trail and a 500' elevation change on the Naulu Trail. Allow 1/2 hour per mile when hiking on these mid-elevation trails. Add additional time for scenic stops and breaks. The ahu (stone cairn) trail markers can be difficult on first sight to distinguish from the surrounding lava. However, the trails are well marked and hikers soon become accustomed to spotting the cairns in the black lava fields. Sunlight may be intense. Hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen are preventive measures against sunburn. Start your trek early to avoid being on park trails during the hottest times of the day.  \u00a0   Health Hazards  The N\u0101pau Trail traverses a portion of the East Rift Zone of K\u012blauea and follows the path that magma takes as it makes its way underground from its source at the summit to the point where it comes to the surface near Pu\u02bbu \u02bb\u014c\u02bb\u014d. The hike is through exposed lava fields and lush rain forests. Pace yourself, drink plenty of water. Pack extra clothing and your sleeping bag in plastic for waterproofness. Raingear is essential. Stay warm and dry; hypothermia (low body temperature) is a killer. Be prepared to treat injuries caused by falls on sharp, glassy lava.  \u00a0   Volcanic Hazards Volcanic eruptions are possible at any time. In the unlikely event of a lava outbreak along the trail, move uphill and upwind of eruptive activity. Earth cracks, thin crusts, and lava tubes are numerous. Fire Hazards Trails in the park traverse areas which contain very flammable grasses and brush. Open fires and smoking are prohibited!  \u00a0   Give us your feedback - Let us know about trail, cabin, or campsite conditions.
