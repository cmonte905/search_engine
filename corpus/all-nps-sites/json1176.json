Approximately 0.8 miles of Crater Rim Drive is now open to hikers, and visitors can enjoy an easy and accessible roundtrip walk through koa and \u02bb\u014dhi\u02bba forest on pavement all the way to the Keanak\u0101ko\u02bbi Crater overlook. Across the road, another overlook provides panoramic views of Halema\u02bbuma\u02bbu Crater and Mauna Loa.  The park has also reopened about 0.7 miles of Crater Rim Trail from Chain of Craters Road just north of Lua Manu Crater. This section of trail winds through native forest, along the flows of 1974, and culminates at the south side of Keanak\u0101ko\u02bbi Crater. Both routes offer an abundance of diverse and breathtaking views.  \u00a0   Keanak\u0101ko\u02bbi, meaning \"cave of the adzes\", likely formed during the 1400s, during K\u012blauea's great summit collapses. Until 1877, Hawaiian kahuna k\u0101ko\u02bbi (carving experts) sought the crater's superior and rare basaltic rock for making ko\u02bbi, or adze heads. Bound to a sturdy \u02bbau ko\u02bbi (wooden handle), this valuable tool was used to carve vital objects like canoes and houses. But the famous adze quarry was covered by lava, first in 1877, then again during the fissure eruption in July 1974. Today, the crater floor is 115 feet deep. The park closed Crater Rim Drive from Jaggar Museum to Chain of Craters Road and portions of Crater Rim Trail for public safety after Halema\u02bbuma\u02bbu began to erupt in March 2008 and volcanic fumes caused poor air quality. Halema\u02bbuma\u02bbu continues to erupt, and Crater Rim Drive remains closed from Keanak\u0101ko\u02bbi to Jaggar Museum.  \"Thanks to a new sulfur dioxide monitoring network, and an increase in air quality monitoring tools at our fingertips, we can effectively evaluate air quality conditions,\" said Park Ranger and Chief of Interpretation Jim Gale. \"We encourage park visitors to take advantage of the newly opened section of road and trail,\" he said.  The Keanak\u0101ko\u02bbi area may still experience high levels of volcanic fumes with changing wind conditions. Should this happen, the park will temporarily close the site to visitation. Interpretive signage in the area features a QR code for smart phones, which connects to the national award-winning Hawai\u02bbi SO2 Network website, www.hawaiiSO2Network.com.    \u00a0   Return to: Day Hikes Overnight Backcountry Hikes Journals Hikes Things to Do Weather and Climate Air Quality", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/havo/planyourvisit/keanakakoi.htm", "title": "Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park: Keanak\u0101ko\u2018i"}
