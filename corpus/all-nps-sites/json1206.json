Altogether, 67 mammal species are known to be native to the area, but grizzly bears, gray wolves and bison were locally extirpated in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The lynx and wolverine are either extirpated or extremely rare.  Moose are now commonly seen in the park, but they were not historically recorded as being part of this particular area of the Rocky Mountains.
