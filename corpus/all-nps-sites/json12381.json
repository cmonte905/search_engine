{"body": "Officers' Club        The modern-day Officers' Club at the Presidio National Park Service, GGNRA   \u00a0   One of San Francisco\u2019s oldest buildings, the modern-day Officers\u2019 Club was part of the original Spanish Presidio constructed in the late eighteenth century. Adobe walls dating to the 1790\u2019s were incorporated into the front wings of the building when it was first rebuilt by the army around 1847. The structure was used from the beginning of the American military\u2019s occupation of the Presidio; early additions also included a wooden pavilion-like assembly room (the Moraga room today) completed in 1885. During the 1930\u2019s, funding from the Works Progress Administration led to the remodeling of the building to include Mission Revival style elements. In the process, substantial remnants of the historic adobe walls were enclosed in lath and plaster and still compose much of the front portion of the building.  \u00a0     The Mission Revival style tower was added to the Officers' Club in the early 1970s.   Today\u2019s Officers\u2019 Club contains many styles, building materials, and historical epochs. The building boasts a complex mixture of adobe, concrete, wood-frame, and steel frame components. More recent renovations continue the use of rustic Spanish-tile gable roofs, heavy rough timber lintels and beams, and decorative iron work that characterize early Spanish colonial architecture. The result is one of the Presidio\u2019s most historic and aesthetically pleasing buildings.  \u00a0   Main Post main page \"Places\" main page", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/prsf/learn/historyculture/officers-club.htm", "title": "Presidio of San Francisco: Officers' Club"}
