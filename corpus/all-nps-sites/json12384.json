Bob Bowen Collection   \u00a0   Halfway down Funston Avenue, the Alameda (Spanish for \u201cavenue\u201d) served as the official entrance to the Presidio from the 1860\u2019s until 1895. During this period, cannonballs lined the streets as a form of decorative curbing and soldiers stood guard at the U.S. Army\u2019s preeminent western post. Today, little evidence of the Alameda remains other than the four large Victorian houses that border the old post entrance where Presidio Boulevard meets Funston Avenue.  \u00a0    Two of four large officer's quarters built on the Alameda.    \u00a0   Main Post main page \"Places\" main page", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/prsf/learn/historyculture/alameda.htm", "title": "Presidio of San Francisco: The Alameda"}
