It is easy to imagine that the quiet forests are simply occupied by only giant trees.  They are, of course, home to many animals, including birds.  Though hundreds of species of birds have been recorded in Redwood National and State Parks, only a few are regularly encountered on a hike in the parks\u2019 giant forests. As with forest birding everywhere, most of your detections will be by call or song only.  A small bird perched on a tree branch 200 feet (60 meters) above your head is very difficult to see, as is an equally small bird hiding in the thick forest undergrowth.  Fortunately, many online bird guides and mobile phone applications can help you identify various bird calls.    When walking through the old growth redwoods on a park trail, the five most common birds you will most likely encounter include:   -Pacific-slope Flycatcher (Empidonax difficilis) \u2013 song sounds like \u201cps-seet, ptsick, seet!\u201d -Pacific Wren (Troglodytes pacificus) \u2013 song a rapid, variable, series of high pitched trills. -Varied Thrush (Ixoreus naevius) \u2013 song a whistled, flutelike single toned note with varied pitch. -Golden- crowned Kinglet (Regulus strapa) \u2013 song extremely high pitched \u201ctsee\u201d notes and trill. -Wilson\u2019s Warbler (Cardellina pusilla) \u2013 song rapid chatter, descending in pitch. Ten other species you most likely will encounter include:   -Pileated Woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) -Hutton\u2019s Vireo (Vireo huttoni) -Steller\u2019s Jay (Cyanocitta stelleri) -Chestnut-backed Chickadee (Poecile rufescens) -Swainson\u2019s Thrush (Catharus ustulatus) -Hermit Warbler (Setophaga occidentalis) -Dark-eyed Junco (Junco hyemalis) -Red-breasted Nuthatch (Sitta Canadensis) -Hairy Woodpecker (Picoides villosus) -Brown Creeper (Certhia Americana)", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/redw/learn/nature/birds-of-the-old-growth-forest.htm", "title": "Redwood National and State Parks: Birds of the Old-growth Forest"}
