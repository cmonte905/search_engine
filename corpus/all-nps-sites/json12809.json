{"body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Basic Information     Weather              Weather       Temperature varies by elevation. Because the parks range from 1,500 feet to 14,494 feet in elevation (457 m to 4,418 m), conditions change drastically depending on where you are! Continue to the bottom of this page if you need links to weather forecasts.  THE FOOTHILLS (chaparral shrubs and oak woodlands), below ~4,000': These lower elevations are characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. Precipitation usually occurs from January to mid-May; rain in the summer is rare. Average rainfall is about 26\" (66 cm). During the winter, low-hanging clouds often drift in from the west, obscuring the countryside for several days at a time.    *FOOTHILLS TEMPERATURES  JAN  FEB MAR  APR  MAY  JUN JUL  AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC    Extreme Low   20\u00b0 -7C   22\u00b0 -6C   26\u00b0 -3C   29\u00b0 -2C   31\u00b0 1C   38\u00b0 3C   42\u00b0 6C   46\u00b0 8C   37\u00b0 3C   30\u00b0 -1C   26\u00b0 -3C   18\u00b0 -8C     Average Low   36\u00b0 2C   39\u00b0 4C   41\u00b0 5C   46\u00b0 8C   52\u00b0 11C   61\u00b0 16C   68\u00b0 20C   67\u00b0 20C   52\u00b0 11C   43\u00b0 6C   37\u00b0 3C   36\u00b0 2C     Average High   57\u00b0 14C   61\u00b0 16C   64\u00b0 18C   70\u00b0 21C   79\u00b0 26C   89\u00b0 32C   97\u00b0 36C   96\u00b0 36C   91\u00b0 33C   80\u00b0 27C   67\u00b0 19C   58\u00b0 14C     Extreme High   84\u00b0 29C   85\u00b0 29C   85\u00b0 29C   92\u00b0 33C   104\u00b0 40C   114\u00b0 46C   113\u00b0 45C   111\u00b0 44C   112\u00b0 44C   103\u00b0 39C   93\u00b0 34C   82\u00b0 28C                 *(Fahrenheit over Celsius)  THE MIDDLE ELEVATIONS (the conifer forest belt, including giant sequoia groves), ~4,000' to 7,000': Summer in this forested area of the parks offers warm days and cool evenings. These elevations receive an average of 40-45\" (102-114 cm) of precipitation annually. Much of this falls during the winter, resulting in a deep blanket of snow from December to May. Sub-zero temperatures are rare. In the summer, occasional afternoon thundershowers may occur. In fall and winter, Lodgepole Campground is generally 10-15 degrees F (6-9\u00b0C) colder than the average middle-elevation temperature shown on the chart. Summer temperatures in Cedar Grove are generally hotter than the average for the middle elevations, and cooler than the foothills. Mid-summer temperatures may reach the 90\u00b0s (35-40\u00b0C). Cedar Grove is closed in the winter due to frequent rockfalls on the road.    *MIDDLE ELEVATION TEMPERATURES   JAN    FEB    MAR    APR    MAY    JUN    JUL    AUG    SEP    OCT    NOV    DEC     Extreme Low   -6\u00b0 -21C   -4\u00b0 -21C   0\u00b018C   8\u00b0 -13C   13\u00b0 -11C   22\u00b0 -6C   34\u00b0 1C   28\u00b0 -2C   23\u00b0 -5C   11\u00b0 -12C   4\u00b0 -20C   -4\u00b0 -20C     Average Low   24\u00b0 -4C   25\u00b0 -4C   26\u00b0 -3C   30\u00b0 -1C   36\u00b0 2C   44\u00b0 7C   51\u00b011C   50\u00b010C   45\u00b0 7C   38\u00b0 3C   31\u00b0 -1C   27\u00b0 -3C     Average High   42\u00b0 6C   44\u00b0 7C   46\u00b0 8C   51\u00b0 11C   58\u00b0 14C   68\u00b020C   76\u00b024C   76\u00b024C   71\u00b022C   61\u00b016C   50\u00b010C   44\u00b0 7C     Extreme High   68\u00b020C   70\u00b021C   76\u00b024C   77\u00b0 25C   83\u00b028C   91\u00b0 33C   92\u00b033C   94\u00b034C   90\u00b032C   82\u00b028C   96\u00b036C   73\u00b023C                *(Fahrenheit over Celsius)  \u00a0   Click National Weather Service: Parks of the Southern Sierra for a written current forecast for Sequoia, Kings Canyon, and Yosemite national parks.
