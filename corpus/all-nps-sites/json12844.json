Monitoring allows for the determination of how treatments achieve the park\u2019s primary fire management objectives, serves as an early detection of change, and provides information on effective strategies for the future. ResearchResearch studies expand upon the park\u2019s current knowledge base and allow for refined fire management objectives.
