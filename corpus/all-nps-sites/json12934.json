Herr/U.S. Forest Service  Yosemite National Park\u2019s special status bird listings can come from state and federal designations. Four bird-related state ratings apply in Yosemite right now, with the newest listing\u2013-California Bird Species of Special Concern\u2013-incorporating a higher degree of scientific evidence. (No federally listed designations currently apply in Yosemite.) The following Yosemite National Park\u2019s bird species carry a special status declared by the state (view definitions of special status categories):  California Endangered (CE) California Species of Special Concern (CSC) California Fully Protected (CFP) California Bird Species of Special Concern (BSSC)   Willow flycatcher\u2014CE Bald eagle\u2014CE Great gray owl\u2014CE American peregrine falcon\u2014CFP (removed from CE list in November 2009) Harlequin duck\u2014CSC, BSSC Northern goshawk\u2014CSC, BSSC Northern harrier\u2014CSC, BSSC Golden eagle\u2014CFP Long-eared owl\u2014CSC, BSSC California spotted owl\u2014CSC, BSSC Vaux\u2019s swift\u2014CSC, BSSC Black swift\u2014CSC, BSSC Olive-sided flycatcher\u2014CSC, BSSC Yellow warbler\u2014CSC, BSSC  \u00a0     American peregrine falcon D. Gomez/U.S. Forest Service  American Peregrine Falcon's Success: This bird of prey is a symbol of a recovering species. In August 1999, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed the American peregrine falcon from the list of endangered and threatened species, marking one of the most dramatic successes of the Endangered Species Act. In November 2009, the peregrine was removed from California\u2019s endangered species list, 10 years after it was federally delisted. Yosemite National Park represents the highest peregrine falcon nesting density in the Sierra Nevada and has played a key role in its recovery since 1978. In 1994, six of 14 pairs in the Sierra Nevada south of Lake Tahoe nested in Yosemite. Active management for recovery of the peregrine has occurred in Yosemite since 1978, including the monitoring of known nest sites; surveying for additional nest sites; removing of damaged eggs for laboratory hatching and rearing; fostering of laboratory-reared chicks into active nest sites; releasing of young into the wild; doing pesticide analysis of eggshells and eggs for population health assessment; and restoring habitat protection. The Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group coordinated much of this effort. Peregrine falcon records in Yosemite date back to 1940 and are notably absent from 1949 to 1975, corresponding with the noted decline and reappearance of the bird nationally. Peregrines were first re-discovered in Yosemite in 1978, breeding on El Capitan. Since the 1980s, climbing closures have often been in place to protect the breeding pairs.
