Confederate soldiers were or\u00addered to burn these structures to pre\u00advent their use by Union sharpshooters. Fortunately, Samuel Mumma and his family had fled to safety before the battle. The Mumma family rebuilt the home in 1863.  \u00a0   \"...a set of farm buildings in our front were set on fire to prevent them being made use of by the enemy.\" Confederate General Roswell S. Ripley This farmstead and cemetery were part of Samuel and Elizabeth Mumma's property in 1862. Warned of the coming battle, the Mummas and their ten children fled to safety. Fearful that Union sharpshooters would use the farm buildings as a strongpoint, Confederates set fire to them. The column of fire and smoke was visible all morning above the battlefield. This fire was the only deliberate destruction of civilian property. One Union soldier remembered, \"Just in front of us a house was burning, and the fire and smoke, flashing of muskets and whizzing of bullets, yells of men \u2026were perfectly horrible.\" The Mummas spent the winter at the Sherrick farm near Burnside Bridge and were able to rebuild in 1863. After the war, the Federal Government compensated residents for damage caused by Union soldiers. However, since this farm was burned by Confederates, the Mummas received no compensation. Starting in 1870 the family deeded interest in this burial ground to local families. Neighbors who suffered from war and came together to rebuild their community, now rest together in this peaceful enclosure.  \u00a0    Alfred Waud sketch of the Mumma Farm burning during the Battle of Antietam Library of Congress   \u00a0    Alexander Gardner photograph of the ruins of the Mumma Farm Library of Congress   \u00a0   Go to the next tour stop - the Union Advance", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/anti/learn/photosmultimedia/tour-stop-6.htm", "title": "Antietam National Battlefield: 6-Mumma Farm"}
