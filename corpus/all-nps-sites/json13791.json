{"body": "A Living Memorial  In the 1930s, landscape architects transformed Mason\u2019s Island from neglected, overgrown farmland into Theodore Roosevelt Island, a memorial to America\u2019s 26th president. They conceived a \u201creal forest\u201d designed to mimic the natural forest that once covered the island. Today miles of trails through wooded uplands and swampy bottomlands honor the legacy of a great outdoorsman and conservationist.
