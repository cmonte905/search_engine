{"body": "Paso de Francia        Christopher Talbot   \u00a0   Paso de Francia crossing, Maverick County, Guerrero, Coahuila, Mexico Paso de Francia crossed the Rio Grande River six miles southeast of Mission San Juan Bautista. It is believed that the name Paso de Francia (France Way) was given to this ford after Alonso De Le\u00f3n's third entrada into Texas in 1689 in search of the colony of Ren\u00e9 Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle. De Le\u00f3n's entry is the earliest crossing that can be accurately ascribed to Paso de Francia, although the Bosque-Larios expedition of 1675 may have also used this ford.
