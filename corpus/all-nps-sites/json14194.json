When I learned that a segment of the historic El Camino Real passes through my property, I was drawn to learn about the road and to photograph its remnants. As I got to know the trail, I came to realize what an amazing piece of history it is. The overlapping historic and modern uses of the trail are the subject of this work.\" said Talbot.
