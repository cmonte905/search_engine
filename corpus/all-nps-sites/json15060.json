Roy Sifford places the cabin shown above \"near the site of the present lodge. To the right would be up valley [west] - to the left down valley [east]\" (Sifford Manuscript:1).  \u00a0   1900-1920  \u00a0    1902--Drake's \"New Log Cabin\" showing south end of the lodge    \u00a0   On June the 20th, 1900, the Siffords' \"took possession of Hot Spring Valley, the beautiful log house that Drake had made, the bath house, a barn and that possible meadow land\" (Roy Sifford interviewed by Les Bodine, 9 Oct 1984).

There was another covered porch on the south end of the building, and a fireplace and flue at the north end. The west (rear) of the building was an unbroken wall without windows or doors and lacked a porch or overhang. Sifford states that the large pipe that served as the fireplace flue was part of a mining flume from the Dutch Hill mine at Seneca (Sifford Manuscript: 6a.). The south porch contained a bench and wash basins for family and guests to wash up before meals.  \u00a0    (Left) 1907\u00a0 The Leichters\u00a0\u00a0 (Right) Lodge n.d.    \u00a0    1910--Standing on porch L-R\u00a0 Ida May, Pearl, and Roy.\u00a0 Alex at far right Susan Watson   \u00a0   In 1912 the Siffords formed the Drakes Spring Company and used the funds obtained from investors to begin a number of improvements that included the construction of a kitchen and dining room, a barn, the rock and cement pool, 20 wooden tent platforms, and completion of the bridge over Warner Creek.  \u00a0    (Left) 1913 Camping permit\u00a0 (Right) Glen French in his tent    \u00a0   Click here to continue on to the next page: The Lodge 1930-1938 \u2192   \u00a0  \u00a0   \u00a0                2004 Bluff Fire   5 Photos            Drakesbad 1939-present   17 Photos  album contains photos of the Drakesbad Lodge from 1939 to present day          Drakesbad Lodge: 1900-1930   6 Photos  album contains photos of Drakesbad Lodge circa 1900-1930", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/lavo/learn/historyculture/drakesbad_lodge.htm", "title": "Lassen Volcanic National Park: The Lodge: 1900-1938"}
