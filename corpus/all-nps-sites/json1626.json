Walnut Canyon National Monument, at 6,900\u2019 elevation, gets approximately 20\u201d of precipitation per year. About 2/3 of this amount comes as rain during late summer monsoons; winter snowfall (58\u201d on average) supplies the rest. Temperatures typically range from near 0 in winter to the mid-90s in summer. But be prepared. Weather in northern Arizona varies tremendously with elevation. Above 10,000\u2019 on the San Francisco Peaks, annual precipitation exceeds 40 inches, temperatures are considerably cooler, and the growing season is remarkably shorter. And 30 miles to the northeast lies desert - at 4500\u2019, the Little Colorado River Basin typically receives less than 7\u201d of rain each year.", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/waca/learn/nature/weather.htm", "title": "Walnut Canyon National Monument: Weather"}
