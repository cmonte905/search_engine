The travertine terraces in Mammoth Hot Springs host thermophilic bacteria. NPS   \u00a0   The word \"bacteria\" is often associated with disease, but only a few kinds of bacteria cause problems for humans. The other thousands of bacteria, although all simple organisms, play a complex role in Earth's ecosystems. In fact, cyanobacteria made our oxygen-rich atmosphere possible. They were the first photosynthesizers, more than 3 billion years ago. Without bacteria, we would not be here.  Almost any hot spring or geyser you see hosts bacteria. Some chemosynthesize, changing hydrogen or sulfur into forms other thermophiles can use. Most photosynthesize, providing oxygen to other thermophiles. All of the cyanobacteria and green nonsulfur bacteria photosynthesize. Some fulfill both roles. For example, Thermus sp.\u2014which are photosynthetic\u2014also may be able to oxidize arsenic into a less toxic form.  Individual bacteria may be rod or sphere shaped, but they often join end to end to form long strands called filaments. These strands help bind thermophilic mats, forming a vast community or mini-ecosystem. Other groups of bacteria form layered structures, which look like tiny towers, that can trap sand and other organic materials.  \u00a0   Thermophilic Bacteria in Yellowstone National Park         Name pH and Temperature Description Location   Cyanobacteria Calothrix pH 6\u20139 30\u201345\u00b0C (86\u2013113\u00b0F) Color: dark brown mats Metabolism: photosynthesis by day; fermentation by night   Mammoth Hot Springs Upper, Midway, and Lower geyser basins     Phormidium pH 6\u20138 35\u201357\u00b0C (95\u2013135\u00b0F) Color: orange mats Metabolism: photosynthesis   Mammoth Hot Springs Upper, Midway, and Lower geyser basins     Oscillatoria pH 6\u20138 36\u201345\u00b0C (96\u2013113\u00b0F) Color: orange mats Metabolism: photosynthesis; oscillating moves it closer to light sources.
