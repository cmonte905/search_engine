NPS / Diane Renkin   \u00a0   The National Park Service (NPS) mission is a dual mandate: preserve Yellowstone\u2019s resources, and make the park available and accessible for enjoyment and appreciation. The ways in which visitors access Yellowstone in winter can affect the park\u2019s plants, animals, and wild character in ways more profound\u2014and potentially more damaging \u2013 than at other times of the year. To meet its mission, the NPS has worked carefully to develop a long-term plan for winter use in Yellowstone that both protects the park\u2019s resources and provides outstanding opportunities \u201cfor the benefit and enjoyment of the people.\u201d For years, the National Park Service managed the park in winter with interim management plans in the face of repeated courtroom challenges over snowmobiles and other winter operations. The final rule, published in October 2013, established long-term management of winter use in Yellowstone and concluded more than 15 years of planning efforts and litigation. Continue: History of the Debate  \u00a0   Quick Facts  The Issue  National Park Service Regulation 36 CFR 2.18 prohibits snowmobile use in national parks when there is no specific rule authorizing their use. This is known as the \"closed unless open rule\"\u2014without a specific rule, oversnow vehicles would be prohibited from entering Yellowstone.
