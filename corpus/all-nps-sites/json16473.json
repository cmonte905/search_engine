{"body": "Explore This Park    Learn About the Park     History & Culture     Collections     HRC Blog                In the Shadow of the Arch       RSS  About This Blog This blog will give you a peek into the stacks and storage areas of Yellowstone National Park's library, archives, and museum collections. We'll highlight some of our biggest treasures, show-off quirky staff favorites, let you know about newly acquired collections, and perhaps ask for help with a few mysteries. Along the way, we hope to give Park staff, visitors, and all those who love Yellowstone a place to reminisce and share the unique story of Yellowstone.
