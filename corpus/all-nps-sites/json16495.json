I\u2019m Jennifer Jerrett.NARRATOR: When I say \u2018top predator of Yellowstone,\u2019 what\u2019s the first thing that pops into your mind? NARRATOR: Well, Vincent Spagnuolo has another idea.  VINCENT: They\u2019re basically the wolves of the aquatic ecosystem here. NARRATOR: Vincent is a loon biologist with BRI, the Biodiversity Research Institute. He heads up BRI\u2019s common loon project in Yellowstone National Park.VINCENT: They are top predators and they own that lake.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 NARRATOR: But in spite of their top-predator status, Yellowstone\u2019s loons are in trouble. There are only about a dozen breeding pairs left in the park. And they\u2019re really isolated:\u00a0 The closest other loons are over 200 miles away. This is Vincent Spagnuolo again, along with Dave Evers, the founder and executive director of BRI.VINCENT: And so, these are the only loons here and they\u2019re basically on an island\u2026 VINCENT: We don\u2019t believe that there\u2019s any immigration or emigration with this population\u2026and that can be an issue when you have a small population with no chance of rescue from the rest of the species range.DAVE: And it could blink out\u2026and it blinks out, we know it\u2019s not going to be recolonized for a long, long time. and < loon wail>NARRATOR: If you want to keep a population from blinking out, if you want to preserve it, first you have to understand what\u2019s going on with it. Scientists are investigating what might be happening with the Yellowstone loons and capture and banding is one way they\u2019re gathering those data. But catching a loon is not easy. VINCENT: They are powerful, powerful birds\u2026And yeah, when we get them in hand we feel that as we get beat up pretty good.NARRATOR: In fact, getting a loon in hand is so tricky that in the early days of loon research just the thought of a reliable capture technique was pretty inconceivable. Biologists basically surrendered to the idea that they\u2019d be outmaneuvered by the birds.JEFF: 35 yrs ago\u2026all of the working loon biologists in North America that I knew\u2014and there weren\u2019t many then--KNEW KNEW that you couldn\u2019t capture a loon and band it.NARRATOR: Jeff Fair has been on the leading edge of loon science for more than 40 years and he\u2019s worked with Dave Evers since the beginning.\u00a0 JEFF: And a few years later this ignorant grad student, by the name of Dave Evers, developed a way to capture and band loons.\u00a0 \u00a0 NARRATOR: And the trick was to go after breeding pairs at night.\u00a0 DAVE: The night capture is a method that really works with the birds.\u00a0 So we\u2019re not chasing the birds. If we tried to chase the loons anyways, we\u2019d never catch them. NARRATOR: Dave Evers\u2019 nighttime technique works because it lets the loons approach the researchers instead of the other way around. Researchers use a spotlight to shine a beam of light on the water that they can kind of hide behind. Then they mimic chick calls. Loon parents are super protective so they approach to find out what\u2019s going on. And if all goes well, the scientists have caught their loon.\u2026NARRATOR: I went out on a night capture attempt with Vincent and his team here in Yellowstone.And as I was about to learn, it\u2019s not just the loons that are tough.\u00a0 NARRATOR: These guys were packing in a car battery--they use that to run the spotlight. If you\u2019ve ever swapped out the battery in your car, you know how heavy those things are!\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 NARRATOR: And they had nets and all this sampling equipmentNARRATOR: Oh, and they were carrying a canoe. Seriously. They had a canoe. NARRATOR: And they hiked all that stuff into the backcountry for like 3 or 4 miles. And there were hills \u2013 I mean, so many hills \u2013 and bugs\u2026NARRATOR: \u2026and even a couple of creek crossings. NARRATOR: And the best part is that the BRI folks were totally upbeat about it all. NARRATOR: We hiked to Yellowstone\u2019s Wolf Lake. The team was trying to recapture the female from that territory; They had banded her last year.  VINCENT: \u201cOne bird\u2019s banded. One\u2019s not. We\u2019re going after the banded bird.\u201d JEN: \u201cHow important is it that you get It?\u201d\u00a0 VINCENT: \u201cIt\u2019s critical. We don\u2019t know where this population winters yet.\u201dNARRATOR: Like a lot of birds, loons are migratory. During spring and summer, the Yellowstone loons breed and raise chicks in the park but they winter somewhere else. Scientists can keep tabs on the birds while they\u2019re in Yellowstone -- address any of the big threats they face here like human disturbance or habitat changes. But that\u2019s only half the picture.\u00a0 VINCENT: \u201cAnd we put a small device called a geolocator on one of its leg bands\u201dNARRATOR: That\u2019s so they could track herVINCENT: \u201cAnd getting that device back, we can download\u00a0  data that will tell us where this bird wintered\u2026we\u2019ll know what kind of threats they face on the wintering grounds and that\u2019s a key piece to the conservation of this population.\u201dNARRATOR: Not to overstate things, but let\u2019s just say that they really wanted to get that geolocator back. Oh and just to kinda up the ante a little bit, the team was\u00a0 0 in 3 in\u00a0 their capture attempts in the park so far this year. NARRATOR: They missed it. NARRATOR: The male from that pair spooked and tremeloed. And that made it a lot more difficult to try to catch the female\u2026and the geolocator. NARRATOR: Once a bird is captured, the team does a work-up. Dave Evers walks us through the steps.DAVE: So when we catch a loon, we want to be fairly speedy and efficient with our time because we want to get that bird back in the water.DAVE: So we go through this process of measuring the bird in many different ways. We want to get the weight of the bird. We want to measure the bill. DAVE: Once we get the measurements we want to take some tissue samples\u2014so, blood and feather. DAVE: Blood\u2019s used for a lot of different reasons. We can look at contaminant analysis like mercury and lead. We can also look at different diseases and parasites. The overall health of the bird.\u00a0 DAVE: So a little vacutainer of loon blood, 5 ccs of blood, can really tell us this world of what\u2019s happening for that loon.\u00a0  DAVE: The feather that we grab, we usually cut the feather DAVE: and that feather tells us from a mercury standpoint how much mercury has been in that bird\u2019s body over its lifetime.DAVE: And then we put bands on their legs\u2026DAVE: \u2026There\u2019s two different banding schemes. One has a band number that fits in to the Federal Bird Banding Lab DAVE: And then we have a unique color banding combination that only that individual would have.DAVE: So that way we can look at that individual loon from the shore with a spotting scope a year, or two, or 10 years later and that\u2019s our way of tracking these birds over time. All of this took less than 20 minutes. And then\u2026VINCENT: \u201cAnd that\u2019s a loon capture\u201dJEN: \u201cHoly cow. That\u2019s not easy. That\u2019s not like any animal capture I\u2019ve ever seen\u201dNARRATOR: One of the things that was so crazy about this capture was the fact that Jeff Fair was able to pilot that canoe in the dark toward a moving bird.\u00a0 Jeff\u2019s paddling is legendary in the loon world.\u00a0 But he shines in teambuilding, too. JEFF: \u201cThere\u2019s one other job that I have. In fact it\u2019s the major contribution I\u2019ve made to loon science and that is when you do a good job, you celebrate. We call it communion. Here\u2019s to the loon.\u201dJEN: \u201cWow. Thanks for including me in on that. Did Vince\u2013I totally cried you guys. See this is why I\u2019m not in science and I do what I do. Oh my goodness, I can\u2019t believe how beautiful that bird was.\u201dJEFF:\u00a0 Loons are a high-profile species. They sing and they dance. They attract people\u2019s attention and people fall in love with them without ever being a biologist. You fall in love with any species and you suddenly realize the complexity of the whole natural web of life. NARRATOR: And that we\u2019re all caught up together in that web. Loons are one of our more sensitive indicator species\u2013a true canary in a co\u00a0  al mine.\u00a0 We\u2019re beginning to understand that threats to loons can be threats to humans, too. DAVE: Yeah, it strikes me just to build on that that there\u2019s this connectivity that I think we\u2019re all--a lot of us--are missing with nature\u2026 that we all want clean air and clean water and a high quality of life and we need nature to provide that.\u00a0  VINCENT: We\u2019re fighting the good fight and that\u2019s for loons and that\u2019s for all species and for advancing research and knowledge of the natural world. I think I\u2019ll stick with loons for a long time not just because of the birds but because of the amazing people that there are. The entire loon world; just really dedicated and amazing people. NARRATOR: And speaking of dedicated and amazing, we still had to hike out. With the canoe. And the car battery. But this time, we had to do it in the dark.
