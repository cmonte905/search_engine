In wet climates, low places fill with water and overflow to the sea. A dry climate evaporates water, leaving behind salt flats or briny lakes. Like most of these locations, Death Valley was not created by a river\u2019s erosion. Movements in the earth\u2019s crust have dropped it to such great depths.  Below Sea Level   Sea level is the average elevation of the world\u2019s ocean surface and is the standard from which all other elevations are measured. Regardless of tides, \u201csea level\u201d remains constant.", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/deva/learn/nature/lowest-places-on-earth.htm", "title": "Death Valley National Park: Lowest Places on Earth"}
