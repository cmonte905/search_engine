{"body": "Twenty Mule Teams          \u00a0   For many people, nothing symbolizes Death Valley more than the famous Twenty Mule Teams. These \"big teams\" pulled massive wagons hauling borax from the Harmony Borax Works near Furnace Creek to the railhead near Mojave, a grueling 165 mile, ten day trip across primitive roads. Although the teams only ran for six years--1883 to 1889--they have made an enduring impression of the Old West. This is primarily due to a successful advertising campaign promoting 20-Mule-Team Borax Soap and the long-running Death Valley Days radio and television program. Today the twenty mule teams are only a fond memory, but you may see two of the last remaining wagons here in Death Valley. One is in front of the Furnace Creek Ranch and the other is at Harmony Borax Works.  \u00a0      Imagine a conversation with a Twenty Mule Team muleskinner... I\u2019m a muleskinner, proud to be one and good at my job. I don\u2019t skin mules--I drive \u2018em, that\u2019s what muleskinner means. You may not know it, but mules is the smartest things on 4 feet. Speakin\u2019 of smart, I work for a real smart man named Coleman who owns the Harmony Borax Works right here in Death Valley. He\u2019d seen some muleskinners drivin\u2019 8 or 12 mules at a time and they was haulin\u2019 some pretty heavy loads, so ole man Coleman he thinks to himself, if 8 mules can pull 10 tons and 12 can pull twice that, it stands to reason that if you hook 20 mules up and build bigger wagons, them mules should be able to pull nigh unto 40 tons. So that\u2019s what Coleman did. Shelled out about $900 for each of 10 wagons, 16 feet by 4 feet by 6 feet deep. Durn things weigh 7800 pounds empty--36 1/2 tons loaded. And them wheels! Them back wheels is 7 feet tall, front ones is 5 feet. Each one weighs 1000 pounds--takes me and 4 more good-sized men to change one of \u2018em. Funny, even though it\u2019s 1888 and we\u2019ve been haulin\u2019 borax outta here for almost 5 years--dang near 10,000 tons--not one of them wagons has broke down yet. Wheels do \u2018cause they take an awful beatin\u2019 in the desert, but them wagons was made real good. They\u2019ll roll forever. So anyways, I\u2019m meanin\u2019 to tell you what my job is like; it ain\u2019t all fun. I\u2019m what\u2019s called a \"long-line skinner\" \u2018cause there\u2019s an 80-foot chain runnin\u2019 the length of the 165 miles of desert from here to the train depot in Mojave. Bennett\u2019s Well is 26 miles south of Harmony, then Mesquite Well, Lone Willow Spring 53 miles later on, Granite Well, Blackwater Well, and 50 miles later is Mojave. Considerin\u2019 the team can only travel at most 17 miles a day, you can see why I gotta carry enough water for everybody. Of course, I don\u2019t drive from June to September--too dang hot, but even so it sometimes gets up to 125 out here. Without that water wagon we\u2019d all be parched up like that skinner who died \u2018cause his head cracked open from the heat. See, I told you it ain\u2019t all fun. Well, me and my swamper--he\u2019s the one who kinda helps me by cookin\u2019, sand-scrubin\u2019 the dishes, and pullin\u2019 on the hand-brake when we get rollin\u2019 downhill a mite too fast--we take off from Harmony when the mornin\u2019 star comes up. I hear a lotta skinners just aswearin\u2019 and carryin\u2019 on to get their mules goin\u2019; well, if you\u2019re good like me you can move \u2018em out just by callin\u2019 their names real quiet-like. Not far south of Harmony we hit some mighty unfriendly territory. I\u2019ll tell you right out, I don\u2019t envy them Chinese laborers who had to take sledgehammers to beat down them sharp salt spears out there to build me a road. All they got was $1.25 a day for doin\u2019 that. My swamper he gets $2.00 a day and me, I get $4.00 a day. See, I said I did my job good--you don\u2019t get money like that for bein\u2019 a nobody. Anyways, we get to Bennett\u2019s Well on the second day out and refill that iron water wagon (one made outta wood would\u2019ve dried up and fallen apart in this heat as soon as it got empty). When we get up to Windy Gap there\u2019s some mighty tight corners I gotta maneuver around. Now I\u2019ll tell you just how smart my mules is: it\u2019s one thing drivin\u2019 along a straight road; it\u2019s a whole nother thing turnin\u2019 corners on a mountain pass. My 2 lead mules, both mares, are about 80 feet ahead of me--so far away I can\u2019t even begin to use my 9-foot long whip on \u2018em. I\u2019ve been known to throw pebbles at \u2018em to get their attention. Aim\u2019s good too. Back to gettin\u2019 around corners. The next 5 pairs of mules are my \"swing teams\", they ain\u2019t real smart, they just know their names and what \u2018pull\u2019 and \u2018stop\u2019 means. Now the next 3 sets of mules behind the swings are my \"pointers\". These mules are trained special to jump over that 80-foot chain and side-step away from the curve to keep that chain tight and my wagons goin\u2019 \u2018round that corner right. I know most folks can\u2019t see in their mind\u2019s eye what in blazes I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about, so I\u2019ll draw it out for you. Next comes the 2 big horses. They\u2019re strong enough to start my wagons rollin\u2019, but that\u2019s all they\u2019re good for. A dumb mule (and I ain\u2019t seen one yet) is a whole lot smarter than a smart horse. When the goin\u2019 gets rough, I ride on the \"nigh wheeler\" or way down. Sometimes I meet \u2018em in the durndest places, and I never did figure out why the empty wagon has the right of way. Don\u2019t make no sense. Speakin\u2019 of no sense--I hear rumors about what a wild bunch us skinners are, just adrinkin\u2019 and agamblin\u2019 and who knows what. Well now, ain\u2019t that bright. Here I am, in charge of 2 lives, 18 mules that cost a pretty penny, 2 horses, and $15,000 worth of borax belongin\u2019 to Coleman and folks say I\u2019m wild. I doubt ole man Coleman would trust his money to someone who ain\u2019t got a lick of sense. Well, had another pretty fair trip--got into Mojave just about 3 pm on the 10th day. Swamper and me got along okay, mainly \u2018cause when he looked like he was rarin\u2019 up to gab I gave him that \"I ain\u2019t listenin\u2019 to no swamper\" look. He knows his place. I know my place too. Right here haulin\u2019 borax outta Death Valley. Ain\u2019t no other place I want to be, no other job I want to be doin\u2019.", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/deva/learn/historyculture/twenty-mule-teams.htm", "title": "Death Valley National Park: Twenty Mule Teams"}
