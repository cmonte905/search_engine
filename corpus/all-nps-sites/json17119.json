{"body": "Outdoor Activities       Congress originally set aside the parkway as part of a \"comprehensive park, parkway, and playground system of the National Capital.\" Here are just a few of the many ways that the parkway lives up to that mission.  \u00a0   Bicycling One lane of the loop road in Fort Hunt Park and the paved multi-use Mount Vernon Trail are flat, car-free places to bicycle.  \u00a0   Canoeing or Kayaking An easy, flat water paddle through Dyke Marsh Wildlife Preserve or around Jones Point Park is the best way to see how the Potomac River shapes the park.  \u00a0   Hiking Easy hikes are available on the Haul Road trail in Dyke Marsh Wildlife Preserve, the Civilian Conservation Corps era trails in Fort Hunt Park, and the interpretive trail at Jones Point Park. Moderate hikes with some steep slopes and rock scrambles are available on the Potomac Heritage Trail and in Turkey Run Park.  \u00a0   Picnicking There are picnic tables at Fort Hunt Park, Jones Point Park, Lady Bird Johnson Park, and Turkey Run Park.  \u00a0   Playing Field or Court Games Several large grassy fields are available for informal games at Fort Hunt Park and Jones Point Park. There are also softball diamonds and Fort Hunt Park and basketball courts at Jones Point Park.  \u00a0   Walking or Running One lane of the loop road in Fort Hunt Park, trails in Jones Point Park, and the Mount Vernon Trail are flat, paved places to run or walk.  \u00a0   Wildlife Viewing Birders will find habitat for wading birds, raptors, and warblers in Dyke Marsh Wildlife Preserve. Wildflowers put on a spectacular show in Turkey Run Park in spring and early summer.", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/gwmp/planyourvisit/outdooractivities.htm", "title": "George Washington Memorial Parkway: Outdoor Activities"}
