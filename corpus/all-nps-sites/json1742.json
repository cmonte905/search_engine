{"body": "Explore This Park    Learn About the Park     Photos & Multimedia     Virtual Tour              Virtual Tour          On this page you will find two different types of content, Quicktime VR (QTVR) Movies and JPEG Panoramic Images.  (QTVR) movies allow viewers to scan right and left and in most cases all the way around. They provide a way of getting an overall impression of a scene and not just one static view. There are two ways to view each QTVR. The first is by left clicking on the link. Doing that will cause the page to change and the movie to open in the new page. The second way is by right clicking on the link and then selecting \"Save Target As\". This will allow you save each QTVR to your own computer. Once saved you will be able to open each QTVR in a seperate Quicktime window on your computer.   Once open, all you have to do is hold down the mouse on the image and drag to the right or left to pan around. Use the + and - buttons to zoom in and out. The same two options hold true for viewing the JPEG Imgaes. Please be aware that these images are very large files and they may take a while to download depending on your connection speed. You can also see these images in our Photo Gallery. Please note that you will need the latest version of Apple's QuickTime software to view the QTVR Movies below. If you do not have the latest version click here to download it for free.  \u00a0    The Parking Lot & Visitor Center  \u00a0      View Of The Visitor Center From The Parking Lot QTVR Movie (2.49Mb) JPEG Image (4.76Mb)  \u00a0    As you get out of your car you admire the construction of the Visitor Center.\u00a0 Built in 1935 after the excavation of the ruins at Tuzigoot, it was made to blend in with the reconstructed ruins and used many of the stones from the excavation.\u00a0    \u00a0      View From Inside The Tuzigoot Visitor Center QTVR Movie (1.55Mb) JPEG Image (3.17Mb)  \u00a0    Going into the Visitor Center you are greeted by some friendly rangers ready to answer questions, and by Western National Parks Association bookstore clerks ready to help you with purchases.\u00a0 The ranger recommends starting in the museum for an overview of Sinaguan life at Tuzigoot.\u00a0 Many of the cases contain intriguing artifacts from the pueblo ruins.\u00a0 Next you\u2019re ready to head up the hill to the Tuzigoot Ruin.    \u00a0    The Tuzigoot Ruin  \u00a0      View From The Tuzigoot Plaza QTVR Movie (2.44Mb) JPEG Image (4.19Mb)  \u00a0    As you start out you climb the hill from the Visitor Center to the first set of rooms.\u00a0 Although the path is a loop, and separates here, you step into the Plaza to get a full sense of the area between these rooms and the main grouping.\u00a0 The only \u2018flat\u2019 place on the hill, this community area was likely used for daily chores and as a play area for children.    \u00a0      View From The East Side Of The Ruin QTVR Movie (2.12Mb) JPEG Image (3.82Mb)  \u00a0    You continue south along the eastern side of the ruins to the bottom of the loop.\u00a0 You turn around to face north, starting your view with the Citadel, or tower room.\u00a0 The only fully reconstructed room in the ruins, it gives you a great idea of what this multi-level pueblo must have looked like.\u00a0 The walls between you and the Citadel denote more living quarters and storage rooms in this 110-room ruin.\u00a0 Finally turning to face south again, you see yet another grouping of rooms and a spur trail to the Southern Point.    \u00a0      View From The Southern Point Of The Ruin QTVR Movie (2.26Mb) JPEG Image (3.87Mb)  \u00a0    After walking the spur trail down to the Southern Point, you turn to the north again to start the scene and get another great view of the Citadel showing its imposing location as it rises above the pueblo ruins.\u00a0 To the west of the ruins is the flat area of the tailings cap where prehistoric farms were likely situated.\u00a0 Since it is winter no plant life is growing yet.\u00a0 However, as you turn south and then east you see the lush, green plant life along the perennial Verde River and then the mesquite trees which grow in the flood plain of the river.    \u00a0   Click on the links to learn more about the Tailings Cap and the Verde River.      View From Inside The Citadel QTVR Movie (1.79Mb) JPEG Image (3.47Mb)  \u00a0    Next you walk back up the hill and continue on the loop towards the west.\u00a0 Some stairs lead you into the first floor of the reconstructed Citadel.\u00a0 As you look at the wall to the right of the stairs up to the Roof Top, you can see a change in the mortar at about shoulder height.\u00a0 The mortar on the bottom half is the original mortar, and you can see the more regulated wall construction above from the New Deal crew who excavated and reconstructed in the 1930s.\u00a0 As you turn around you also see a wall which separated this large room in two.\u00a0 This wall was installed sometime after the room was originally built, showing that the use of this room changed with Sinaguan needs.\u00a0 The roofing material is made to replicate Sinaguan building techniques.    \u00a0      View From The Roof Top Of The Ruin QTVR Movie (1.92Mb) JPEG Image (3.37Mb)  \u00a0    Finally you head up another flight of stairs to the Roof Top. Here you can experience how the people who called Tuzigoot home lived their daily lives. Most room entrances were from the top, and from here you can see all the resources available: the land for farming, the river for water, the mesquite and marsh areas for more food and game. Although it's winter, and Tavasci Marsh in the north-east looks dead with only last year\u2019s cattail growth, you can hear the birds who call that oasis home. And finally, to the north, you see the Visitor Center and museum. This is where our tour ends, and you decide to take the west side of the loop back through the Plaza and to the museum to check out more artifacts recovered from the ruins.    \u00a0      Tavasci Marsh  \u00a0      View Of Tavasci Marsh In Winter From The Western Overlook QTVR Movie (2.34Mb) JPEG Image (4.02Mb)  \u00a0    This western platform looks out across the sloping hillside just a little north of the Tuzigoot ruins.\u00a0 Since it is winter there is a lot of brush on the slope, but no wildflowers have popped up yet.\u00a0 Looking further you can see last year\u2019s growth of cattails in Tavasci Marsh.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to believe that all that light brown area is actually an oasis for birds and other wildlife.\u00a0 As you scan north you see the marsh disappear around the hill.\u00a0 To the south you see the trail that brought you to the overlook and, in the distance, the cottonwood and willow trees that line the Verde River.    \u00a0      View Of Tavasci Marsh In Summer From The Eastern Overlook QTVR Movie (3.00Mb) JPEG Image (4.77Mb)  \u00a0    This eastern platform is much closer to the marsh itself so in the clearing of cattails you can see some of the water that makes Tavasci Marsh so lush.\u00a0 As you look south you see the mesquite brush that surrounds most of the marsh, along with the trail you took to the overlook.\u00a0 Looking north you see the extent of the marsh and cattails and hear all the birds chattering which call the marsh home.    \u00a0   Click here to learn more about Tavasci Marsh.    The Verde River  \u00a0      The Verde River QTVR Movie (2.78Mb) JPEG Image (4.63Mb)  \u00a0    Starting out you look north and see the Citadel of the Tuzigoot ruins on the hill in the distance.\u00a0 Turning west, as you look upriver, you see cattails merging into the cottonwood and willow trees that line the banks of the Verde River.\u00a0 This river was important to the people who lived and farmed at Tuzigoot as a water source.\u00a0 Today it is important as one of Arizona\u2019s last free flowing rivers and as habitat for almost twenty endangered and threatened species.    \u00a0   Click here to learn more about the Verde River.    \u00a0    Shea Spring  \u00a0      View Of Shea Spring QTVR Movie (3.63Mb) JPEG Image (7.69Mb)  \u00a0    After a long hike through Tavacsi Marsh you end up at Shea Spring.\u00a0 This is the spring that feeds the marsh, and creates such a special area for Arizona.\u00a0 First you watch the water tranquilly bubbling up, before turning around to see just how the water affects plant life.\u00a0 Right around the spring are cattails, but as you turn towards the north, and see the boundary fence line, you see the hillside turn more toward typical desert scrub.\u00a0 Such an amazing place!    \u00a0    Images and QTVR's by Joshua Boles - NPS Virtual Tour Text by Sharlot Hart - NPS", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/tuzi/learn/photosmultimedia/virtualtour.htm", "title": "Tuzigoot National Monument: Virtual Tour"}
