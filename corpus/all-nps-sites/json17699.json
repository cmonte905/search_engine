PARC, GGNRA   \u00a0   Architectural Significance of the Porches   The wood-frame barracks at historic Fort Baker were constructed in 1902 to house over one hundred coastal defense soldiers. These buildings, built in the Colonial Revival style, were built from standard army plans, which included the porches as an elegant architectural element.  In the 1950s, probably due to recurring maintenance problems, the army removed the historic porches. The removal of these two-story porches had a negative impact on the integrity and significance of the buildings and lessened their overall appearance.     \u00a0    Building 602, as it stood for over 50 years, without its front porch. October 2006.\u00a0 GGNRA, NPS   \u00a0   Methodology behind the Porch Reconstruction   In December 2006, the National Park Service and the Fort Baker Retreat Group began the rehabilitation project to convert Fort Baker into Cavallo Point, the Lodge at Golden Gate. The rehabilitation plan called for the post\u2019s barracks buildings to be converted into assembly, dining and office space. The National Park Service does not traditionally add missing historic architectural elements back onto buildings unless there is sufficient historic documentation. But because the historic preservation professionals had the original 1905 building plans, as well as several historic photographs, the decision was made to re-construct new porches back onto the barracks buildings. New construction materials were used, so that in later years, future architects and historians would be able to tell the difference between the original 1905 porches and the newly added 2006 porches.  \u00a0    The porch foundation posts were secured in the ground with concrete. Toxic-free, pressure-treated lumber was used anywhere that wood came in contact with soil to prevent putting any more chemicals into the ground. Photo, June 2007.

GGNRA, NPS   \u00a0    In keeping with good design practice and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the historic architects ensured that the new porches included an accessible ramp that lead up to the front door. Photo, November 2007.\u00a0 GGNRA, NPS   \u00a0    The design of the finished ramp, with its new hand rails, provides direct front door access to all. Photo, May 2008. GGNRA, NPS   \u00a0    The black pipe railing was an architectural detail lifted directly from the historic standard building plans. The additional rows of thinner\u00a0 cabling, however, were an added feature that ensured the porch was complaint with all safety codes. Photo, March 2008. GGNRA, NPS   \u00a0    The new front entrance of the porch has wide front stairs with supporting hand rails on either side. The chosen paint colors - off-white porch with the dark gray foundation - is based on the 1930s historic color scheme. Photo, April 2008.
