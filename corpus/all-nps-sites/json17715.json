The Endicott Period, named for Secretary of War William C. Endicott, refers to the era when the War Department expressed growing concerns about the dilapidated condition of the country\u2019s seacoast fortifications. As a response, the army made sweeping recommendations in the 1890s to modernize and re-arm all the U.S. seacoast forts. In 1902, the army constructed new seacoast fortifications at Fort Baker, just inside the Golden Gate strait. By 1908, the army recognized the need for additional defenses, outside the Golden Gate strait, and constructed Fort Barry and its batteries for this purpose.  \u00a0    Fort Barry solders, on the front porch of their barracks, showing off their Model 1903\u00a0 Springfield rifles (photo circa 1908). PARC, GGNRA   \u00a0   Army Life Like most army posts, Fort Barry functioned as a small, self-sufficient town that supported the needs of the soldiers. The post contained the commander\u2019s residence and headquarters, elegant officers\u2019 residences and soldiers\u2019 barracks; it also provided its own hospital, gymnasium, post exchange (for daily supplies), a guardhouse (which jailed the occasional disorderly soldier) and even its own bakery. A soldier\u2019s life in Fort Barry was very isolated. The only method of travelling to neighboring Sausalito, where the soldiers could visit saloons or take the ferry to San Francisco, was via a long and treacherous coastal road. In 1918, after too many near-fatal road accidents, the army constructed the Baker-Barry tunnel, thus improving military communication and travel between the two posts.  \u00a0    This photo shows Fort Barry nestled within the Marin Headlands. The army intentionally constructed the buildings around the main parade ground and planted trees around the post to provide necessary breaks from the wind. (photo circa 1928). PARC, GGNRA   \u00a0   The Batteries at Fort Barry By 1905, the army constructed five powerful batteries at Fort Barry that represented the new Endicott-period upgrades: Battery Mendell, Battery Alexander, Battery Smith-Guthrie, Battery Samuel Rathbone and Battery Patrick O\u2019Rorke. Battery Mendell, the first constructed, was outfitted with the army\u2019s modern innovation: a pair of 12-inch guns on a \u201cdisappearing carriage\u201d.  When the guns were ready to fire, they would pop-up into position, fire a single shot, and then recoil down and out of sight for reloading; hence the \u201cdisappearing carriage\u201d designation. In their loading position, both the firing guns and the soldiers were hidden from enemy view behind the huge concrete parapet, camouflaged with vegetation.  During World War II, Fort Barry was part of the Harbor Defenses of San Francisco, which was responsible for defending the area from enemy attack. Fort Barry\u2019s batteries were upgraded and anti-aircraft guns were installed along the coastline.  \u00a0  \u00a0    Battery Mendell\u2019s 12\u201d gun, installed on the state-of-the-art \u201cdisappearing carriage\u201d, capable of firing a 1,100 pound artillery shell at enemy ships up to eight miles away (photo circa 1910). PARC, GGNRA   \u00a0    A complex underground system of communication cables connected all the batteries so that the men stationed throughout the fort could communicate with one another. In this photo, the soldiers with the headphones are getting word about successful target practices from the men out in the field and then recording this information on the plotting table.

PARC, GGNRA   \u00a0    The officers of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers established an engineering construction camp at the Point Bonita Reservation to manage the construction of the new Fort Barry batteries. They were allowed to bring their wives and children; by 1915, there were so many children living at Point Bonita that the army agreed to provide a school buildings for the families.\u00a0 (photo circa 1915).
