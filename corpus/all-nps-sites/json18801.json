{"body": "The Honeycreepers        The \u02bbI\u02bbiwi, one of the most conspicuous of the park's honeycreepers Photo by Paul Banko.   \u00a0   Hawai\u02bbi's renowned honeycreeper family of birds, all closely related, have evolved into strikingly different species. Likely their common ancestors were lone accidental arrivals to these isolated islands. Then, their offspring fitting into different physical habitat niches, favored those individuals whose physical variation gave them best survival ability. Now, though genetically related, the honeycreepers physical shapes are as varied as woodpeckers and parrots on the mainland. This \u02bbi\u02bbiwi (above) is well adapted to extract nectar from lobeliad type flowers.  Protected by park managers from feral ungulates and predators, Haleakal\u0101 is one of the very few last sanctuaries for these unusual and very rare native Hawaiian birds.", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/hale/learn/nature/honeycreeper.htm", "title": "Haleakal\u0101 National Park: The Honeycreepers"}
