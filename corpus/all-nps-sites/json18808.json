They fly over land at night and are believed to navigate by stars. These, and other seabirds that fly at night, sometimes become confused by lights. The seabirds fly around the lights, become tired and fall to the ground. Here's what to do if you find a grounded seabird.  Quietly approach the bird and gently pick it up with a cloth or hat. Be careful, the bird may bite.  Place it in a covered, well-ventilated box and keep it in a cool and shady place.  Do not give it any food or water.  Immediately call 1-877-428-6911.  Do not release the seabird. It is important that trained wildlife specialists inspect the bird for injuries.  Click on the link below to see a brochure on helping these grounded seabirds.
