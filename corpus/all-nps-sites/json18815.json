Traditional subsistence was based on farming and fishing, and settlements were located in areas best suited for these activities. The K\u012bpahulu area offered fertile soil and abundant water, as well as coastal access \u2013 all within a relatively small geographic area. The richness of the K\u012bpahulu area resources likely supported a large population prior to European contact. Descriptions by early explorers and visitors, as well as archeological evidence, all describe K\u012bpahulu as a well populated and intensively cultivated land.   \u00a0    Taro patch at Kapahu Living Farm NPS Photo   \u00a0   Today, traditional agricultural practices can be experienced in K\u012bpahulu at the Kapahu Living Farm, a non-profit organization that demonstrates Native Hawaiian culture though hands-on activities.
