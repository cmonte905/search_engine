{"body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Basic Information     Weather              Weather      On any given day, the temperatures in the park can range from a high of 80\u00b0F (27\u00b0C) in K\u012bpahulu to a low of 30\u00b0F (-1\u00b0C) at the summit. In either area clouds and rain can quickly replace warm sunshine.  \u00a0  Summit and Wilderness Area  Weather in the high-elevation areas of the park is highly unpredictable and changes often. Cool temperatures, intense solar radiation, and rapidly moving clouds are characteristic. On average, the temperature drops about 3\u00b0F for every 1,000 foot rise in elevation (or approximately 5\u00b0C for every 1,000 meter elevation rise), making the 10,023 foot (3055m) summit of Haleakal\u0101 about 30\u00b0F (or 17\u00b0C) cooler than the coast. Year-round summit temperatures range between below freezing to highs of 50\u00b0-65\u00b0F (10-18\u00b0C). The outside temperatures can feel much colder because of wind chill and damp, overcast conditions. A generalized weather forecast from NOAA is available. However, local conditions can change radically in a matter of minutes. NOAA Forecast for Summit District of Haleakal\u0101 from 7000 ft. to the summit.

Located on the windward (eastern) coast of the island, K\u012bpahulu receives an average of 187 inches (475cm) of rain each year. The proximity of the ocean and the trade winds moderate the temperature and keep it at a daytime average of 70\u00b0-80\u00b0F (21-27\u00b0C) year round. Night time lows average 65-75\u00b0F (18-24\u00b0C). Flash floods are a serious hazard in K\u012bpahulu, so make sure to check at the Visitor Center before entering the streams or pools.
