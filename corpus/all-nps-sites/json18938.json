A Blue Star in the window A service flag like the one above was displayed to show that a member of the family was serving in the armed forces of the United States. The color of the star gave an indication to the status of the person currently serving. A blue star for a living family member and a gold star for one that had sacrificed their life. The flags were first used during WWI, but the practice was not standardized until WWII.", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/miin/learn/historyculture/nisei-in-uniform.htm", "title": "Minidoka National Historic Site: Nisei in Uniform"}
