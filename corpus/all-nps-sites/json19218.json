Few plants can rival the lovely bloom of this low growing plant, a blossom that ranges from deep rose to almost white. In 1895, inspired by its beauty, the people of Montana named this their state flower. Ninety years earlier, the Expedition first encountered the plant. At that time, in late August of 1805, instead of admiring the flower, Meriwether Lewis saw and tasted the root. Writing in his journal, Lewis described the root as \u201ccilindric and as white as snow throughout, except some small parts of the hard black rind which they had not seperated in the preperation\u2026 [the roots] became perfectly soft by boiling, but had a very bitter taste, which was naucious to my pallate, and [I] transfered them to the Indians who had eat them heartily.\u201d Given this description, Lewis might vigorously endorse the common name of this plant: bitterroot. Although Lewis little relished it, the Shoshone, his hosts in August of 1805, thoroughly enjoyed the boiled root. Each year, before the plant flowered, American Indians collected this important food source, which grows from California to Montana, and from British Columbia to Arizona. Along the Trail, the Northern Shoshone, Flathead, and Nez Perce harvested the bitterroot. Many other tribes throughout the bitterroot\u2019s range also collected and traded the highly valued plant. Despite the powerful effect it had on Lewis\u2019s tastebuds, the bitterroot received scant attention in the Expedition journals. Nearly a year after his first taste of bitterroot, Lewis again encountered the plant. In early July of 1806, at Traveler\u2019s Rest in western Montana, Lewis collected a bitterroot plant, and three other species, to add to the collection he would present to President Jefferson. His only record of this encounter with the bitterroot notes that, \u201cI found several other uncommon plants specemines of which I preserved.\u201d Upon the Expedition\u2019s return, the bitterroot became one of 134 plant specimens presented to Frederick Pursh for analysis and identification. Pursh gave the plant its scientific name, Lewisia rediviva, commemorating Meriwether Lewis\u2019s role in bringing the plant to the attention of western science and describing the plant\u2019s apparent ability to return from the dead. In his Flora Americae Septentrionalis, Pursh noted that the specimen Lewis carried from Montana, deprived of water and soil for several years, had been planted. Although no flower blossomed, Lewis's bitterroot had \u201cvegetated for more than one year.\u201d Rediviva, a Latin word, translates to \u201cbrought back to life.\u201d More information on the bitterroot is available in the following books and websites.
