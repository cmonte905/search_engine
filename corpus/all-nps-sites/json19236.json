{"body": "William Clark         William Clark by Charles Willson Peale, from life, 1807. Independence National Historical Park  One hundred sixty three years after his death, William Clark received a promotion. In 2001, President Clinton promoted Clark from Lieutenant to Captain. Although Clark\u2019s captaincy was late in coming, to have called the famous journey of 1803 to 1806 simply the Lewis Expedition would have been inaccurate in spirit, if not in fact. Meriwether Lewis and William Clark shared equally in the tasks and responsibilities of their cross-continental journey. Twenty years before the Lewis and Clark Expedition, Thomas Jefferson asked William Clark\u2019s older brother and Revolutionary War hero, George Rogers Clark, to head an overland expedition to the Pacific. General Clark declined the offer. When Meriwether Lewis accepted command for the 1803 Expedition, however, it wasn\u2019t the eldest Clark brother he sought as co-commander, but a younger member of the Clark clan, William. Anticipating the rigors of a journey to the Pacific Ocean, Lewis informed Clark that \u201c\u2026under those circumstances in this enterprise, \u2026it\u2019s fatigues, it\u2019s dangers and it\u2019s honors, believe me there is no man on earth with whom I should feel equal pleasure in sharing them as with yourself.\u201d Lewis\u2019s regard for Clark grew out of shared service. Only a few years earlier, when both men had served in the U.S. Army in Ohio, Clark had been Lewis\u2019s commanding officer. Although the two men believed they would share the captaincy of the Expedition, word that Clark would remain a lieutenant arrived shortly before they departed St. Louis. The men of the Expedition, having spent a winter addressing \u201cCaptain Clark\u201d were not told of the difference between their two leaders. William Clark\u2019s contributions to the Expedition are those of a captain. The map he created as they traveled was, at the time, the most accurate map of the trans-Missouri West. His stable personality balanced Lewis\u2019s moodiness. And when Lewis\u2019s pen fell silent during many months of the journey, Clark\u2019s words, straightforward and creatively spelled, became the record of the Expedition. William Clark also left his mark along the Trail. On July 25, 1806, Clark scratched his signature into a sandstone formation along the Yellowstone River in Montana. Recording the event in his journal, Clark noted that \u201c[t]his rock I ascended \u2026 had a most extensive view in every direction...I marked my name and the day of the month and year.\" He called the formation Pompey\u2019s Tower, using a nickname Clark had bestowed on Sacagawea\u2019s son Jean Baptiste, or Pomp. The etched signature can still be seen at the site, now called Pompeys Pillar, near Billings, Montana. Clark\u2019s signature is believed to be the only remaining on-site physical evidence of the expedition. Having crossed a continent, Clark returned to St. Louis to build a successful and varied life of family and work. In addition to fathering seven children, William Clark temporarily cared for Sacagawea\u2019s son, Jean Baptiste. After Lewis\u2019s death, Clark completed the work of the Expedition by helping to prepare the journals for publication. Clark\u2019s fair diplomatic relations with American Indians during his years as brigadier general of the militia, Superintendent of Indian Affairs of the Upper Louisiana Territory, and Governor of the Missouri Territory, gained him the esteem of his peers. Although the second-ranked commander of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, Clark proved to be a first rate leader, both during the Expedition and after. Like his signature on Pompey\u2019s Pillar, William Clark\u2019s life has left a lasting imprint on our history.
