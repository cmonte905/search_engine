Departing St. Louis on May 14, 1804, the Corps of Discovery began its journey in earnest. That spring day marked the culmination of years of hope, desire, and planning that had both inspired and tormented Thomas Jefferson. The innate curiosity that drove Jefferson\u2019s interest in a many subjects \u2013 among them agriculture, archaeology, horticulture, languages, law, mathematics, music, natural history, and philosophy \u2013 also fueled his curiosity about the West. For more than twenty years before the Corps of Discovery, Jefferson had been trying to mount an exploration of the West. Although the Corps of Discovery fulfilled Jefferson\u2019s dream of western exploration, theirs was Jefferson\u2019s fourth attempt. In 1783, while still a member of Congress, Jefferson asked General George Rogers Clark to lead an exploration of the lands west of the Mississippi River. General Clark\u2019s business affairs prevented his accepting the offer and the plan went no further. Only a few years later, however, Jefferson persuaded John Ledyard to attempt a trek from Moscow, across the Bering Strait, and, continuing east, across the North American continent. Ledyard\u2019s arrest while still in Russia quickly ended this endeavor. During Jefferson\u2019s term as Secretary of State he won support of the American Philosophical Society to fund an expedition \u201cto find the shortest & most convenient route of communication between the U.S. & the Pacific ocean, within the temperate latitudes.\u201d In 1793, Jefferson selected French botantist Andr\u00e9 Michaux to lead this expedition. After the revelation that Michaux was a secret agent of the French Republic, this project also came to an sudden end.   That spring morning in 1804 marked the beginning of the fulfillment of Thomas Jefferson's decades long dream of western exploration.
