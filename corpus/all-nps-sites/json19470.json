{"body": "Stories          The history of the Civil War around the Buffalo River lacks the glory that has been attached to major battles that occurred in the South. War along the Buffalo was absent of large scale military maneuvers or battles, but it was more consumed with jay hawking, terrorism, and guerilla tactics; a shadow war. The isolated lifestyle of most Arkansans left them uninterested in the trials of war; however, the presence of war began residing on their door step. Family's allegiances were questioned as elements from the Confederacy and Union both attempted to gain a foothold in Northwestern Arkansas, but neither side fully succeeded in their quest. Left in their wake was a civilian culture that had been ripped to shreds by the stresses of murder, rape, and thievery.
