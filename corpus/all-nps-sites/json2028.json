{"body": "Windows and Door Casings       The original door and window casings of the Tumac\u00e1cori Mission church were built of wood. As those casings deteriorate from dry rot, termites, and other aging processes, it is necessary to duplicate the originals and replace them, filling in with new lime plaster and sometime portions of the adobe blocks that have fallen away.  \u00a0    Photo by Jana Tschopp   \u00a0    Photo by Jana Tschopp   \u00a0    Photo by Jana Tschopp   \u00a0    Photo by Jana Tschopp", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/tuma/learn/historyculture/windows-and-door-casings.htm", "title": "Tumac\u00e1cori National Historical Park: Windows and Door Casings"}
