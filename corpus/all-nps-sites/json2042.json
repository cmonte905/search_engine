Their fifth child, Maria Rita, had been born at 4:00 that morning.           Rita was the family\u2019s only girl. Her brothers, Jes\u00fas, Francisco, Valerio and Ignacio, were between twelve and six years older than she was, and all of the children had been baptized at the Tumac\u00e1cori mission, where the family lived.           Rita\u2019s little brother Andr\u00e9s arrived when she was not quite two years old. The baby lived for only two months before Fray Balthasar laid him to rest beneath the floor of the church. Their grandfather, Don Juan Cris\u00f3stomo Ram\u00edrez, had been buried beneath that same floor when Valerio was a baby, before Rita and Ignacio were born.           Rita\u2019s grandparents had brought their family north to Tumac\u00e1cori from their previous home near the Guevavi mission in the 1760\u2019s. Rita\u2019s mother, Guadalupe, and Rita\u2019s tia Valeria and tio Manuel all had been baptized at Guevavi.           When she was sixteen, Rita married twenty-six year old Ignacio Pacheco. His mother\u2019s family, the Romeros, had also made the move to Tumac\u00e1cori in the 1760\u2019s, and Ignacio had been born in Tubac while his parents were living there at the Presidio. An aging bachelor, at the time of his marriage to Rita he was living with his mother in Tucson.          The couple settled in Tubac, where their first three children were born. The last record that we find of Rita and Ignacio in Mission 2000 comes when she is 33. Their second known child, Austacia Carmen, apparently named for Ignacio\u2019s mother, Mar\u00eda del Carmen Romero, died when she was just two months old and was buried by Fray Narciso Gutierrez of Tumac\u00e1cori in the cemetery at Tubac.           We found Rita in the Mission 2000 records while searching for a Tumac\u00e1cori resident to be part of a living history presentation set in the 1820\u2019s. Later, we were thrilled to find her husband, listed as witness to a wedding in the Tubac records, which had not yet been translated into the database. It was historian Philip Halpenny, attending that first living history program, who introduced me to the rest of Rita\u2019s story. Rita and her husband obtained the first registered brand in the Tubac area, the \u201cdiamond bell.\u201d The family moved to Tucson in the early 1820\u2019s, where Ignacio was elected to serve as the town\u2019s second Alcalde. Her four surviving children \u2013 three boys, Guadalupe, Miguel, and Ram\u00f3n, and one girl, Jes\u00fas \u2013 left a long line of descendants, some of whom still live in the Tucson area.           I continue to portray Rita in living history presentations for visitors to her home, Tumac\u00e1cori, and on tours to missions Calabazas and Guevavi.", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/tuma/learn/historyculture/maria-rita-duran.htm", "title": "Tumac\u00e1cori National Historical Park: Mar\u00eda Rita Dur\u00e1n"}
