GarateDecember 2003          It is possible that Mar\u00eda Emerenciana Romero was the daughter of Diego Romero and Mar\u00eda Bojorquez, but it is more likely that she was the daughter of Nicol\u00e1s Romero and Emerenciana Perea. She was born before the Romeros moved to the San Luis Valley east of present-day Nogales, Arizona/Sonora and we, thus far, have not found a birth record for her. If we assume the latter scenario to be correct, Diego and Mar\u00eda were her grandparents. One thing is certain, she was a mestiza, because both Diego and Nicol\u00e1s were. Another thing is just as certain \u2013 she was raised on the Romero\u2019s Santa Barbara Ranch south of the Guevavi Mission.          Considering the close proximity of the Santa Barbara Ranch and the Guevavi Ranch, we can assume that she and Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Sosa grew up together because his parents, Manuel Jos\u00e9 de Sosa and Nicolasa Gom\u00e9z de Silva, operated the Guevavi Ranch for the Anza family. We can even imagine \u201cEmerenciana\u201d and \u201cIgnacio\u201d being childhood sweethearts. They were married at Mission Guevavi in 1744 as recorded by Padre Juaqu\u00edn Felix Diaz:\u201cOn November 5, [1744] Ignacio de Sosa and Mar\u00eda Emerenciana Romero were married in church ceremony. Godparents and witnesses were Jos\u00e9 Apodaca and Mar\u00eda Loreta Montoya, in certification of which I sign.                          Juaqu\u00edn Felix Diaz (rubric).\u201d          At least four children were born to them (all baptized at Guevavi) between November 15, 1745 and August 22, 1762. Even though they eventually moved to Tumac\u00e1cori at the advice of the famous Tubac Presidio Captain, Juan Bautista de Anza, it would appear from the latter baptismal date of the son, Juan Lorenzo, that they were still ranching in the San Luis Valley in 1762. The baptismal record of one of their daughters, Francisca Manuela, shows the relationship they had with the Anza family well before the younger Juan Bautista became captain of Tubac, when he was not yet twenty years old. From page 106 of the Guevavi baptismal book we read: \u201cOn October 22, [1755] I solemnly baptized Francisca Manuela, infant daughter of Ignacio Sosa and Mar\u00eda Emerenciana Romero. Godparents were Don Juan de Anssa and Antonia Margarita Gomez.                            IHS Francisco Pauer, Minister of Doctrine for His Majesty\u201d          Sometime in the ten years between 1762 and 1772, Ignacio and Emerenciana moved to Tumac\u00e1cori as evidenced by the record of Ignacio\u2019s death and burial. He is buried beneath the ruins of the old Jesuit church at Tumac\u00e1cori as we read in on page 175 of the Tumac\u00e1cori death records:\u201c141 - Spaniard - Ignacio Sosa. On the 28th of September in the present year of 1772, Ignacio Sosa died in this village of Tumac\u00e1cori in receipt of the holy sacraments. He was the husband of Mar\u00eda Esmerencia Romero, Spanish speakers. He was given church burial inside the church, and for this truth I signed. Fray Bartholome Ximeno (rubric)\u201d          After Ignacio\u2019s death and nearly 30 years of marriage, Emerenciana, undoubtedly deeply saddened by the passing of her childhood sweetheart, moved to Tubac. One can only wipe a tear from the eye when thinking of the sadness and loneliness of this heroic frontier lady when the next entry from page 17 of the Tumac\u00e1cori Mission book is read:\u201c135 \u2013 Juana Mar\u00eda, Infant of Tubac, daughter of unknown father. On the 2nd of July 1775, I, the undersigned in this Mission of Tumac\u00e1cori, provided the ceremony of solemn baptism for a little baby girl, who was baptized under extreme necessity by Mar\u00eda Susana Garc\u00eda, a resident of the Presidio of Tubac who is well instructed in these matters. She is the daughter of Mar\u00eda Emerencia Romero and an unknown father. She was given the name of Juana Mar\u00eda, and for this truth I sign.Fray Thomas Eixarch (rubric)\u201d          Unfortunately, our record ends there. Although Emerenciana appears eight times over the years in the mission records as a godmother, a death record for her has never been found", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/tuma/learn/historyculture/maria-emerenciana-romero.htm", "title": "Tumac\u00e1cori National Historical Park: Maria Emerenciana Romero"}
