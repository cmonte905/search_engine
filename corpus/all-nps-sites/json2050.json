Cayetana lived at the mission with Pedro, Bernarda, another sister, Teresa, who was about seven years old at the time, and her parents, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albisu and Josepha Rivera.         When Cayetana was not yet in her teens, she met her future husband, a fellow Papago who would be named Manuel Pacifico at his baptism.  Manuel came to the mission from the Papaguer\u00eda with his parents, who tried out mission life for a while, then decided to return to the desert. Manuel, however, was already hooked by young Cayetana.  He returned to Tumac\u00e1cori, was instructed in Christian doctrine, and was baptized.  A month later, he and Cayetana were married.  Manuel was somewhere between sixteen and twenty-two years old at the time.  His new wife was thirteen.          Manuel died only two years later, leaving Cayetana a widow at the age of fifteen.  Six months after Manuel\u2019s death, she married the son of Tumac\u00e1cori\u2019s governor, a Pima man about ten years older than herself.  Jos\u00e9 Domingo Arriola had lost his first wife and ten day - old baby boy just three months before.           After three years of marriage, Cayetana and Jos\u00e9 Domingo had their first baby, a little boy whom they named Vicente.  The baby lived for only two months before dying in their home in Tumac\u00e1cori.  A year and a half later, they had another baby.  Mar\u00eda Nicolasa lived only a few hours before dying late in the afternoon on the day of her birth.  This time, Cayetana became pregnant immediately.  They named their next little girl Mar\u00eda Nicolasa, too, something that people often did when they lost a very young baby.  Unfortunately, little Nicolasa didn\u2019t live much longer than her namesake, dying in her parents\u2019 home at the age of two months.          Cayetana never had another child.  An epidemic swept through Tumac\u00e1cori in 1805, taking her with it on May 14.  Cayetana and her three babies are all buried in the old Jesuit cemetery at Tumac\u00e1cori.  She was twenty-five years old.          Three months after her death, thirty-five year old Jos\u00e9 Domingo married again, to thirteen year old Guadalupe Zu\u00f1iga of Tumac\u00e1cori.", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/tuma/learn/historyculture/cayetana-albizu.htm", "title": "Tumac\u00e1cori National Historical Park: Cayetana Albizu"}
