Garate          There is often not much information about a person associated with an individual mission record, but sometimes a story about someone can be compiled by pulling several entries together. There is a major problem, however, with reading mission records, aside from smudged and faded ink, torn and missing pages, poor handwriting and archaic Spanish. One must understand that things are not necessarily in chronological order before trying to pull together anybody\u2019s story. Sometimes the pages have fallen out of the book and have been stuck back into it in the wrong place. And beyond that, baptisms always come first and then it is a toss-up as to whether deaths or marriages will come next. So, if you go from the front to the back of the book, you often have children being born to parents who haven\u2019t been married yet, or people dying before they were married. It is not unusual to find children who were born before their parents were married, but I have yet to find anyone who was married after they died. This can cause confusion and is never really understood until the difficult-to-read records have been loaded into a data base, which Tumac\u00e1cori National Historical Park is doing at this time with the mission records of this area.           Take the Pima Indian lady, Ana Mar\u00eda, for example. Of course, there were many Pima Indian ladies with that name \u2013 some with a surname and some without \u2013 but this particular Ana Mar\u00eda was born and lived somewhere out in the vicinity of Mission Santa Mar\u00eda Suamca (over the mountain from Patagonia, Arizona, near present-day Santa Cruz, Sonora). Her birth date is unknown but she most likely was born sometime in the 1740\u2019s.  On page 77 of the Suamca book we find the first reference to her. \u201cOn March 13, 1768 I solemnly baptized and anointed with oil and chrism eight-day-old Mar\u00eda Francisca, the legitimate daughter of Ignacio and Ana Mar\u00eda. Godparents were Juan Ignacio and Catalina, Pimas of the village of Santa Mar\u00eda Suamca, whom I advised of their spiritual parentage and then signed it: Miguel Ger\u00f3nimo Elias Gonzales (rubric)\u201d            This, of course is a straight forward entry and by itself raises no questions. The baby was healthy, the mother and father were both there for the baptism, as were two worthy godparents. The problem, that is unseen in the record, is that Ana Mar\u00eda was not married to Ignacio. Not only was she not married to him, but, by church law, she couldn\u2019t be. She was legally married to another man at that time. One has to skip over to page 102 to find that information:\u201cOn January 8, [1766] Francisco and Ana Mar\u00eda, Juan and Elena, and Ignacio and Isabel were married in church ceremony.  Witnesses were Juan Josef, Crist\u00f3bal, the catechist, and many from the village. Before me \u2013 Diego Josef Barrera, Minister for His Majesty\u201d           So, here we have Ana Mar\u00eda marrying Francisco in a triple wedding ceremony some two years before the birth of little Mar\u00eda Francisca to her and Ignacio. With the use of first names only, the question arises, \u201cIs this the same Ana Mar\u00eda, and how can you tell?\u201d One has to turn to page 104 to obtain that information.  There, in the same entry is the death record of Francisco and the marriage of his widow, Ana Mar\u00eda, to Ignacio:\u201cOn August 3, 1768, I, the undersigned, after having interred in the cemetery of this mission of Santa Mar\u00eda Suamca, the skull and some of the bones of Francisco, a child of the said mission who was killed three years ago by the Apaches, the Governor, Pedro, Alcalde Javier, and many others being witnesses to this truth, and acting on the said supposition that it freed Ana Mar\u00eda, who was his wife, to enter a marriage contract, I make the following statement: I married Ignacio and Ana Mar\u00eda in church ceremony according to what is mandated by the Council of Trent and sacred canon.  Witnesses were Pedro, the Governor, Javier, the Alcalde, and many others, for which truth I sign on the said day, month, and year.  Before me - Fr. Francisco Roche\u201d            And thus ends the mystery. Ana Mar\u00eda was married to Francisco. The ceremony was performed by Diego Barrera, the last Jesuit to serve at Suamca. He was arrested and marched to Spain via M\u00e1tape, Guaymas, Tepic, Mexico City and Vera Cruz the following year during the general expulsion of the Jesuits.  In the meantime, Francisco disappeared and was presumed to be dead, although there was no physical evidence of it. So, Ana Mar\u00eda and Ignacio took up residence together. It was while an interim priest, locally born and raised Miguel Elias Gonzales from Arizpe, was visiting Suamca that Ana Mar\u00eda\u2019s baby daughter was baptized.              The first and only Franciscan to live at Suamca, Padre Francisco Roch, a Catal\u00e1n from Spain, arrived in July of 1768.  In August Francisco\u2019s bones were discovered, two years and eight months after he and Ana Mar\u00eda were married. Father Roch gave the remains a proper church burial.  On the same day he legalized the marriage of Ana Mar\u00eda and Ignacio. Then, just two months later, the Mission of Santa Mar\u00eda Suamca was attacked and destroyed forever by Apaches. The battle lasted all day and when night fell, the inhabitants, most likely including Ana Mar\u00eda and her new husband, fled south to Coc\u00f3spera.  \u00a0      To learn more about this person go to Mission 2000 by clicking (here) and following the blue ID numbers.
