A \u201criparian\u201d area is the lush corridor of water \u2013 loving plants growing along the banks of a river.  These ecosystems are essential habitat for many plants, birds, and other animals which could not otherwise live in the surrounding desert and scrub environments.  \u00a0     Mesquite bosque NPS Photo  Mesquite Bosque Environment Away from the riverside, the land in Tumac\u00e1cori is covered with mesquite bosque (forest). Hackberry, ash, and Mexican elderberry mix with mesquite, acacia and palo verde trees near the riparian corridor.  \u00a0     Mesquite scrub environment   Mesquite Scrub Farther from the river in the hills around Tumac\u00e1cori, as well as at the Calabazas and Guevavi Mission units, the land is drier. The shade of the lowland mesquite bosque environment gives way to primarily mesquite and acacia, with the addition of cholla and barrel cacti.", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/tuma/learn/nature/naturalfeaturesandecosystems.htm", "title": "Tumac\u00e1cori National Historical Park: Natural Features & Ecosystems"}
