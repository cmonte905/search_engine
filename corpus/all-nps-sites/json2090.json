{"body": "Explore This Park    Learn About the Park     History & Culture     Research     Detective Work                Detective Work      by  Anita Badertscher  March 2005           One of my favorite things to do with Mission 2000 is to get sidetracked.  I start out with one train of thought, in search of some particular bit of information. . . then I come across something that looks suspicious, and off I go following one tangent after another, finding events that need to be connected up in the database.  Soon, Don\u2019s desk is littered with little notes about people who need to be reunited with parts of their history.  Case in point:  Looking through some marriage records for a likely character for this article, I came across an ox driver named Ignacio, who was marrying an O\u2019odham woman, Juana, at Tumac\u00e1cori in 1772.  Now, whenever a new person is entered into the database, they are assigned a personal ID number.  Ignacio\u2019s number was 11446.  This was a second marriage for Ignacio, and there was a death record listed for his first wife, Ana Mar\u00eda.  When I looked at this death record, however, I found that the husband \u201cIgnacio\u201d who attended Ana Mar\u00eda\u2019s funeral had a different ID number:  9666!  Poor Ignacio had developed a split personality.  When a translator is entering information into the database, one of their most important, and most difficult, jobs is to try to connect the pieces of each person\u2019s history.  If the translator can ascertain that the Jos\u00e9 and Mar\u00eda who got married in 1772 are the same Jos\u00e9 and Mar\u00eda that brought a baby for baptism in 1773, those people are given the same ID numbers for each event, and thus their lives begin to come together in the database.  Often, who is who doesn\u2019t become clear until subsequent entries \u2013 and the job continues to get trickier as Mission 2000 grows.  This is where the fun of \u201cgetting sidetracked\u201d comes in.  Today\u2019s tidbit about poor Ignacio landed on Don\u2019s desk, and back I went to my computer, once again searching for a good story.  I settled on Mar\u00eda Nicolasa Dur\u00e1n.  Nicolasa was already a widow when she married a Tubac soldier at Tumac\u00e1cori in 1775.  When she married her third husband in 1788, she gained a twelve  year \u2013 old stepson, Nicolas Amado.  Nicolas\u2019s godmother was an old friend of mine, Bartola de la Pe\u00f1a, wife of Juan Cris\u00f3stomo Ramirez.   Considering that the boy\u2019s mother had been a Ramirez, it didn\u2019t take too long to figure out what Bartola was doing at this baptism \u2013 she was his grandmother.  However, in the process of tracking down this fact, I got sidetracked once again.  I found myself looking at Bartola\u2019s daughter, Mar\u00eda de la Soledad Valeria Ram\u00edrez.  Not wanting to type the entire long, complicated name into the Mission 2000 search page, I chose \u201cSoledad\u201d as the simplest way to find her, and typed it in.  Up came a list of eleven people, one of them (number 4003) being my Mar\u00eda de la Soledad Valeria Ramirez, confusingly identified in the title line as \u201chija parvula de (infant daughter of) Jos\u00e9 Manuel Ram\u00edrez.\u201d However, once I looked at the actual baptismal record, the parents who brought her for baptism at Guevavi in 1759 were indeed my friends Cris\u00f3stomo Ram\u00edrez and Bartola de la Pe\u00f1a.  Oops, another note for Don.  Among the eleven \u201cSoledad\u201ds in the search results list was another intriguing entry.  One \u201cMaria Soledad Ramirez.\u201d  (number 1553).  This woman witnessed two baptisms at Tumac\u00e1cori in 1774.  The Mar\u00eda Soledad born to Cris\u00f3stomo and Bartola (number 4003) would have been fifteen years old in 1774 \u2013 a perfectly respectable age to get married, or to become a godmother.  I found another piece of this woman\u2019s history through sheer dumb clumsiness.  Back at the search page, I somehow accidentally typed \u201cSoledad\u201d into the surname blank rather than the given name blank.  Much to my surprise, there she was again, this time as \u201cMar\u00eda Valeria Soledad\u201d (number 2725).  Now, she was getting married at Tumac\u00e1cori, in 1775, to Juan Ignacio Romero, son of Mar\u00eda Susanna Garcia and Antonio Romero, who was the son of Diego Romero, another old friend.  So now I have learned that Mar\u00eda de la Soledad Valeria Romero,  who incidentally was Tia (Aunt) to my living history character Rita Dur\u00e1n, was married to Ignacio Romero (making him Rita\u2019s newly discovered Tio), who was also incidentally, by virtue of his relationship to Diego, Rita\u2019s mother \u2013 in \u2013 law\u2019s cousin.  Whoa.  This is news!  Three different priests had recorded these entries in the Guevavi and Tumac\u00e1cori record books, writing her name as they heard it: Francisco Pauer, her baptism, Gaspar de Clemente the baptisms where she was godmother, and Tom\u00e1s Eixarch, her marriage.  When these three personal ID numbers have been put together into one,  all of these pieces of Soledad Valeria\u2019s life will be together again for the first time, and we will know her better.  And THAT is the joy of getting sidetracked in Mission 2000.", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/tuma/learn/historyculture/detective-work.htm", "title": "Tumac\u00e1cori National Historical Park: Detective Work"}
