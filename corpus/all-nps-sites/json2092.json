Some priests recorded more detail than others regarding the ceremony and its participants, but all were concise, business \u2013 like statements of the facts.  Sometimes, if we are lucky, a priest might mention some identifying information about a ceremony participant, such as their occupation, or the fact that they were blind or crippled. Every once in awhile, we get a real treat when a bit of subtext slips into a mission record entry \u2013 a bit of opinion and personality showing through the priest\u2019s sparse words.          Padre Agust\u00edn de Campos arrived from Spain as a young man and spent the rest of his life ministering to his far \u2013 flung flock from Mission San Ignacio.  Padre Campos gave us some interesting glimpses of life, observations such as \u201cvery kind old widower,\u201d \u201cretarded and single,\u201d and \u201chumpbacked.\u201d   He conducted three services for a man from his village whom he referred to each time as \u201cLazaro el flojo\u201d (\u201cLazaro, the lazy\u201d).  In 1719 he buried the wife of a man whom he described as \u201cFelipe el puerco\u201d (literally, \u201cFelipe, the pig,\u201d meaning brutish and ill \u2013 bred)!          Toward the end of his two year stay at Guevavi, Father Ignacio Pfeffercorn recorded an intriguing burial.  Agust\u00edn, a young man from Calabazas, \u201cdied on the mountain,\u201d \u2013 probably the mountain next to Calabazas that we now know as San Cayetano \u2013 \u201chaving eaten Sacred Datura.\u201d  The padre reports tersely, \u201cHe was buried in a ravine.\u201d  It appears that the young man\u2019s behavior did not merit a trip down the mountain for proper burial at the mission.          A recent addition to the Mission 2000 record comes from Fray Antonio Ramos, missionary to Caborca when he wrote this entry in 1785.  The entry documents the baptism of Mariano, one \u2013 day old son of Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda de los Dolores Burques.  The identity of the child\u2019s father was in question, but not, it seems, to the discerning eye of Fray Ramos:  \u201c. . . and, for a father, it is evident that it is Jos\u00e9 Manuel Escalante. . . . The proof for the reason this is evident is because the said Dolores had obscene intercourse with the said Escalante, then with Don Felipe Mendoza, having first consented with him before the said intercourse with the said Escalante, but the child was born looking like the said Escalante and not the said Mendoza.\u201d          Father Gaspar Stiger provided us with some of the most colorful descriptions in the Mission 2000 records.  Take, for example, the case of Padre Stiger and Luisa Segura.  The Swiss priest was fifty years old and had been ministering in New Spain for fifteen years when he baptized the first of Luisa\u2019s two children at Magdalena.  In recording this event, Father Stiger wrote, \u201cOn February 25 (1745) I solemnly baptized Juan Mar\u00eda, infant son of Luisa Segura, a single prostitute (\u201cputa soltera\u201d) from Santa Ana.\u201d  \u201cPuta\u201d is not a word that one should use in polite company.           The only other time that this word appears in Mission 2000 comes two years later, when Father Stiger baptized Luisa\u2019s second child.  This time, he also pointedly annotated the boy\u2019s name in the margin with the word \u201cilig\u00edtimo\u201d  (illegitimate), and concluded the record with \u201cVease a\u00f1o 45,\u201d (\u201cSee the year 1745\u201d) so that we will be sure not to miss any of Luisa\u2019s transgressions.          When he was sixty-three years old, Father Stiger had a particularly irritating November.  Early in the month he reports that Catalina, a resident of his own mission San Ignacio, \u201cburst from an intestinal blockage caused by eating too much meat during the slaughter.\u201d  She received no sacraments, and was buried \u201cwithout cross and without light and without ringing the bells.\u201d  And, one might be tempted to add, \u201cso there!\u201d  Later that same month in \u00cdmuris, the padre buried another woman named Catalina who died, he says, \u201cwithout being confessed due to having glutted herself with excessive eating of squash.\u201d  Well, let that be a lesson to us all!", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/tuma/learn/historyculture/personal-glimpses.htm", "title": "Tumac\u00e1cori National Historical Park: Personal Glimpses"}
