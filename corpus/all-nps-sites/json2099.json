{"body": "Pimer\u00eda Alta         Padre Kino's chain of missions extended as far north in the Pimer\u00eda Alta as San Xavier del Bac near Tucson.   When the Spanish first arrived in this area, they called the O'odham Indians Pimas. This area of present-day southern Arizona and northern Sonora, Mexico, became known by the Jesuit order of Catholic missionaries as the Pimer\u00eda Alta, and is still known by the same name today. The Spanish words Pima-er\u00eda alta mean \"place of the upper Pimas\" in English. Beginning in the 1680's, the lush river valleys of the Pimer\u00eda Alta attracted Padre Kino and other Jesuit missionaries to the O'odham communities already established along the riverbanks.", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/tuma/learn/historyculture/pimeria-alta.htm", "title": "Tumac\u00e1cori National Historical Park: Pimer\u00eda Alta"}
