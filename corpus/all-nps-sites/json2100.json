Missions were communities established to convert Native Peoples to Christianity and the Spanish way of life. The Jesuit religious order of Catholic missionaries administered them until the time of their expulsion in 1767. From 1768 until after Mexico earned its independence in 1821 the missions were operated by the Franciscan religious order of Catholic missionaries. Some are still in use today while others have fallen into ruin. The mission sites of San Jos\u00e9 de Tumac\u00e1cori, Los Santos \u00c1ngeles de Guevavi, and San Cayetano de Calabazas are administered by Tumac\u00e1cori National Historical Park; the park offers tours of its three mission sites. Missions of the Pimer\u00eda Alta include: San Jos\u00e9 de Tumac\u00e1cori Los Santos \u00c1ngeles de Guevavi San Cayetano de Calabazas San Ignacio de Sonoitac San Xavier del Bac Santa Mar\u00eda Suamca Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de los Dolores de C\u00f3sari San Ignacio de Cab\u00farica Santa Mar\u00eda Magdalena San Jos\u00e9 de \u00cdmuris La Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n De Caborca San Diego del Pitiquito San Antonio Paduano de Oquitoa San Pedro y San Pablo de Tubutama Nuestro Padre San Francisco de \u00c1til Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del P\u00f3pulo del Bisanig Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de los Remedios de Do\u00e1gibubig  Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar y Santiago de Coc\u00f3spera Santa Gertrudis del S\u00e1ric  \u00a0     Ban\u00e1michi Photo by Mike Hopkins  When Father Kino first came north to the Opater\u00eda, his last jumping off point before moving up the valley to establish his home mission of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de los Dolores de C\u00f3sari, was the already established mission to the Opata Indians called Los Santos Reyes de Cucurpe.
