After the expulsion of Padre Liber\u00f3s by the new Mexican government because of his having been born in Spain, Tumac\u00e1cori never had another resident missionary. Other Franciscans tried to keep the missions opperating by visiting them from a distance, but Guevavi, Sonoitac, and Calabazas were abandoned in that order. Eventually, in December of 1848, Tumac\u00e1cori was also abandoned.
