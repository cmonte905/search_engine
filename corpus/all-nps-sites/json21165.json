{"body": "Amelia Boyton Arrest       Amelia Boynton: There were 67 people who were standing along the side of the courthouse, and they said, \u201cGet in this line.\u201d He said, \u201cGet in this line.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to my office.\u201d He said, \u201cI said get in this line.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to my office.\u201d I said, \u201cGet in this line.\u201d   He ran behind me, and I just didn\u2019t think that he would do anything. But he grabbed me in the back, propelled me around and started pushing me down the street. At that time I didn\u2019t know whether I should forget about non-violence, take my left hand as I am left handed and give him a sock in the eye, or whether I should go limp, or permit him to push me. And these 67 people said, \u201cGo on Mrs. Boynton. Go on to jail. We\u2019ll be there with you.\u201d And of course he pushed me a half block, threw me into the car, and carted me off to jail. And naturally I felt very badly. I started crying.
