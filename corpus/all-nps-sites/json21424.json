As the 2013 Artist in Residence at Kobuk Valley National Park, she completed the tapestry seen here, \u201cWolf at the Door.\u201d Phillips works as a training supervisor for the Community Health Aid Program at the Kanakanak Hospital in Dillingham, and has also lived in Barrow and Kotzebue. In her free time, this versatile artist paints murals, illustrates books, sews, embroiders, and, of course, creates tapestries with an eclectic mix of textiles.  \u00a0      \u201cSince I was little, I loved to do art,\u201d Philips said. \u201cIn our family, that was more important than many things. My father took oil painting lessons, and my mother sewed all of the time.\u201d Later, as a nursing professional in Barrow, Elaine was asked by a friend to \u201ccome up with a ribbon embroidery kit\u201d to sell through a mail-order catalog. The leftovers from that enterprise sparked a new artistic interest\u2014making realistic flowers out of ribbons. At Kobuk Valley\u2019s Onion Portage, Elaine was given the perfect inspiration for her new textile collage: A wolf, literally at her door. \u201cWe had blueberry pancakes for breakfast all three days, and on the last day, I wanted to go outside [to cut fabric],\u201d Philips said. \u201cI opened the door, and there was a wolf. He was sniffing the air, like, where\u2019s the blueberries? I kept watching for a long time, sending out loving thoughts. After a long time of just looking at each other, he...turned and walked away.\u201d Philips added that wolves are usually very skittish, so this was an unusual event.  \u00a0      \u201cI had wondered what would be the point of my time at Onion Portage, and it became obvious. So I looked at my pile of scraps\u2026and Linda [Jeshke, of the National Park Service] had a wolf tail that she gave me a bit of, and that is the wolf\u2019s tail in the collage.\u201d If you look closely, you can even see a figure of Elaine, framed in the tiny doorway. She is thinking \u201clove,\u201d and the wolf is thinking \u201cpancakes.\u201d \u201cNature is so perfect to me,\u201d Philips said. \u201cI think God is the best artist, and anything I copy is going to come out good.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/kova/getinvolved/elaine-philips.htm", "title": "Kobuk Valley National Park: Elaine Philips, 2013"}
