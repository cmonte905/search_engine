July 24, 2014 Posted by: Kathryn Myers  0 Comments     Fourth of July festivities are never complete without fireworks and exuberant children. Your holiday celebrations this year may very well have mirrored those in Port Alsworth in the summer of 1953. However, fireworks in the hands of kids can lead to terrible accidents. Such was the case 61 years ago when the children's fun and games resulted in a forest fire. July's Object of the Month is a birch bark basket that was hastily made by a woman from Nondalton to carry water to fight the fire near Port Alsworth. The story reminds us that kids will be kids, and good neighbors are a blessing.  \u00a0   June 2014 - \"Two in the Far North\"  June 04, 2014 Posted by: Kathryn Myers  0 Comments     June\u2019s object of the month is a book: \u201cTwo in the Far North,\u201d the biographical novel written by the \u201cGrandmother of the Conservation Movement\u201d Margaret Murie.

Small glass beads, so ubiquitous and easily overlooked in today's society, open a small window into the lives of those who precede us. Through these tiny flashes of color comes a glimpse of the personal tastes of individuals long gone; individuals whose lives were as full and rich as our own. In our January Object of the Month blog post we share a variety of glass beads found at the Dena'ina Athabascan village of Kijik on the shores of Lake Clark. archeology, Alaska Natives  \u00a0   December 2013: Winter is Coming  December 02, 2013 Posted by: Katie Myers  1 Comments     Winter arrives in the Lake Clark country long before the solstice marks the official start of the season.

We're kicking off this new blog series with Dick Proenneke's November 28, 1968 journal entry, in which he describes his first Thanksgiving spent in his new cabin at Upper Twin Lake.  The start of November begins the busy holiday hustle and bustle. We might do well to emulate Proenneke by taking time to notice and enjoy life's simple pleasures, like a light breeze, the fast moving clouds, good food, the stars and moon, a fire when it's stormy out, and our last marshmallow.", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/lacl/blogs/Object-of-the-Month.htm", "title": "Lake Clark National Park & Preserve: Object of the Month Blog"}
