According to legend, these people were never seen again. Now we know differently.  It is the story of 24 Southwestern tribes, including the Hopi, Zuni, and numerous Pueblos whose oral history links them to the Ancestral Puebloans once inhabiting the mesa tops and cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde.  Archeologists support this connection by noting the similarities between artifacts and cliff dwellings discovered at the ancient sites, and the traditions, structures, and cultural objects used by today\u2019s tribes. While the stories told about these ancient people have changed over time, try to form your own stories about these people by studying the artifacts they have left behind.
