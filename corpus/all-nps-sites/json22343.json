{"body": "Inventory & Monitoring        Scorpionweed (Phacelia crenulata) NPS photo by Neal Herbert   \u00a0   To make sound management decisions, park managers need to know how and why natural systems change over time, and what amount of change is normal. National Park Service scientists monitor the \u201cvital signs\u201d of national park ecosystems\u2014much like a physician measures a patient\u2019s heartbeat and blood pressure to determine well-being and help diagnose problems.  The Northern Colorado Plateau Network (NCPN), which is part of the National Park Service\u2019s Inventory & Monitoring Program, collects long-term data on a variety of natural resources. Ecologists then organize, analyze, and synthesize those data and provide the results to park staff. The information collected can provide early warning of ecosystem changes, allowing park managers to develop mitigation measures and reduce management costs.  At Hovenweep National Monument, the network monitors climate, land surface phenology, landscape dynamics, springs and seeps, and water quality. To complete its work, the network collaborates with\u2014and relies on help from\u2014park staff as well as staff from other federal and state agencies, non-profit organizations, and universities.
