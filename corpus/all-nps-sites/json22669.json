While this might bring excitement to your camping experience, please remember that a bear that has become habituated to humans and their food will ultimately need to be killed.  Follow these simple procedures in our campgrounds: \u2022 Use the bear-proof storage lockers provided to secure food and any scented products like beverages (other than water), toothpaste, deodorant, tobacco, sunscreen, bug repellant etc. Do not store these items in your tent or pop-up trailer.  \u2022 If lockers are full or not available, secure food and scented items in your locked vehicle with windows rolled up.  \u2022 Clean up your campsite and table after eating.  \u2022 Lock the dumpsters at South Rim after depositing your trash.", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/blca/planyourvisit/camping.htm", "title": "Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park: Camping"}
