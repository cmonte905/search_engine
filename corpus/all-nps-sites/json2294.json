This is to protect the park's cultural and natural resources and public interest. It is also to reduce any potential conflict between your group and park visitors.  Such activities that require a Special Use Permit \u00d8 Weddings and commitment ceremonies \u00d8 Sporting events as organized walks \u00d8 Trips organized by scouting groups, non-profit organizations \u00d8 Filming (ANY non-amateur work, including public television and other government entities) \u00d8 Photography (for publications or retail) \u00d8 Any after-hours use When in doubt, it is best to apply for a special use permit.   To request a Special Use Permit (Application) The permit application must be requested at least 4-6 weeks in advance of planned activity. Some activities will require consultations with other park divisions for any resource disturbance that might occur. A non-refundable fee of $100.00 will be charged.   Application Request must include: \u00d8 Who is requesting the permit? Name, address and telephone number of the permittee (if the permit is for more than one person, this person is responsible for the behavior and compliance of the entire group.
