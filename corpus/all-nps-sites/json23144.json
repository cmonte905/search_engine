Mitigating the effects of climate change is the story of our time. It is accepted within the scientific community that these effects are felt more keenly in Alaska than in temperate regions of the planet. Research indicates that within park boundaries vegetation is changing, average annual temperatures are rising, wetlands are shrinking, glaciers are thinning, and permafrost is melting. While these stories reflect tremendous impact, they have not been widely or comprehensively shared.  This anthology seeks to tell larger stories of climate change in Denali as actual stories, as five accomplished local authors describe the effects of a changing climate on the lives and landscape they treasure here.   \u00a0   Foreword KATHLEEN DEAN MOORE: \"The Rules of Rivers\"     Rising Temperatures JULIE COLLINS: \u201cWhen Snow Becomes Rain and Other Impacts of Warming Weather on Subsistence Life in Alaska\u201d     Shrinking Wetlands CHRISTINE BYL: \u201cCrane, Water, Change: A Migratory Essay\u201d     Vegetation Changes TOM WALKER: \u201cWinners and Losers: Plant Regimes in Flux\u201d     Melting Permafrost ERICA WATSON: \u201cNotes on Mud and Latin\u201d     Thinning Glaciers CAROLYN KREMERS: \u201cDenali, Thinking Like a Glacier\u201d      \u00a0      Learn more about the latest Climate Change Research in Denali", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/dena/getinvolved/dca.htm", "title": "Denali National Park & Preserve: Denali Climate Anthology"}
