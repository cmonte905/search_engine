{"body": "Forked Lightning Ranch - Tex Austin; the Fogelsons         Poster segment from Tex Austin's 1926 Chicago Rodeo poster, located in Room 6 of the Forked Lightning Ranch house. NPS Photo    And Then There Was Tex   When 20-year-old Clar\u00adence Van Nos\u00adtrand left home in 1908, he rein\u00advent\u00aded himself for a life of ad\u00adven\u00adture. He changed his name to John Van Aus\u00adtin, but every\u00adone knew him as \"Tex.\" Although born into a strict St. Louis hous\u00adehold, he claimed to have been born and raised on a cattle ranch in Victo\u00adria, Texas.     After working on New Mexi\u00adco and Texas ranch\u00ades and briefly joining the Mex\u00adican Revolution, Tex Austin started produc\u00ading rode\u00ados. From his first in El Paso in 1917 to his last in Lon\u00addon, England in 1934, Tex was known for his generosi\u00adty and show\u00adman\u00adship. When he produced the first Mad\u00adison square Garden Rodeo in 1922, the prize money was a record $25,\u00ad000. Tex had other \"fir\u00adsts\":      The first recorded indoor rodeo in Wichi\u00adta, Kansas (1918)   First rodeo ever held in Chicago Stadium (1926)   First contest rodeo to go over\u00adseas--some 114,000 people attended his 1924 rodeo in Lond\u00adon's We\u00admbley Stadium.   Everyone agreed that Tex pos\u00adsessed \"tremendous charm and bluff\" and \"spent his last dollar like it was a leaf and he owned the forest.\" Tall and lanky, he was not consid\u00adered a decent working cow\u00adhand by his cowboys, but \"he did learn to wear a big hat and to sit his saddle as if born to the leather.\"   In 1925, Tex bought up parcels of land on the old Pecos Pueblo Grant and called his 5,500 acre holdings the \"Forked Lightning Ranch.\" The remains of Kozlowski's Stage Stop and Tavern on the Santa Fe Trail (1858-1880) became part of his new holdings, which Tex converted into ranch headquarters and a trad\u00ading post.     He hired architect John Gaw Meem to design and build the main ranch house on a bluff above the Pecos River. (The assignment was one of Meem's first. He later became famous throughout the Southwest for his \"Pueblo Revival\" buildings.) All rooms in the rectan\u00adgu\u00adlar house faced a grassy patio. Its defining touch was a huge, specially sculpt\u00aded steer head mounted out\u00adside on the chimney.     When Tex decided to run a dude ranch at the property, he advertised it as \"the most complete, mod\u00adern and comfort\u00adable ranch house in the West. The life of the romantic West is at its doors.\"       \"Way Out West an' a Little Bit South\"     Tex hoped for a share of the grow\u00ading East Coast tourist market to New Mexico. The ranch, after all, was less than two days by train from Chi\u00adcago: \"Thir\u00adty-four hours, and you're out where the West is--and will be for some time.\" Train travelers disembarkedat Rowe, just a few miles down the road.     For $125 a week, 18 guests sharing nine bedrooms received \"all proper service...to insure the comfort and friendly atmosphere of a country home...Feed--and how!...served ranch style...in big heaping dishes. Pitch till you win and no one keeps track of the helpings!\" A highlight? \"Pack and chuck wag\u00adon trips to the high peaks.\"      The Forked Lightning was a work\u00ading cattle ranch and, for a time, a dude ranch. The dude ranch only operated for seven years; the last guests left in May 1933. Tex had heavily mortgaged the ranch and could\u00adn't pay the debt. A year later, his attempt to produce anoth\u00ader London rodeo fell on hard times--British animal rights groups tried to stop the show on the grounds that steer-wrestling was cruel. Tex lost more than $20,000.     After losing the ranch, Tex moved to Santa Fe and opened the Los Ran\u00adcheros Restau\u00adrant near the Plaza. In October 1938, Tex com\u00admit\u00adted suicide. Rumor at the time was he had been told he was going blind. Tex Austin, the \"Daddy of Rodeo,\" was named to the Na\u00adtional Cowboy Hall of Fame in 1976.     A New Breed     In 1936, W. C. Currier bought the Forked Lightning Ranch, and five years later sold it to E. E. \"Buddy\" Fogelson, a Dallas oil man and ranc\u00adher. Over the next 25 years, Mr. Fogelson purchased land to the south, expand\u00ading the ranch to 13,\u00ad000 acres. The Forked Light\u00adning be\u00adcame a small cattle ranch and Tex's ranch house the Foge\u00adlson summer home.     After Mr. Fog\u00adelson mar\u00adried the actress Greer Garson in 1949, the ranch house became a center for gracious enter\u00adtaining. Active in ranch life, Mrs. Fog\u00adelson unsuc\u00adcessfully tried to raise white Short\u00adhorns imported from her native Scotland. While attending a cattle auction in 1958, Mr. Fogelson im\u00adpetuously pur\u00adchased a purebred Santa Gertrudis bull named \"Gee Gee\" which, with three heifers pur\u00adchased at the same auc\u00adtion, became the founda\u00adtion for the Forked Light\u00adning Santa Gertr\u00adudis herd.     Santa Gertrudis, the first offi\u00adcially recognized American breed of cat\u00adtle, was developed on the famous King Ranch in Texas. A cross be\u00adtween a Brahma and Shor\u00adthorn, the breed resulted from an effort to pro\u00adduce good beef ani\u00admals better suited to the heat, humidi\u00adty, and range con\u00addi\u00adtions of South Texas. When Mr. Fogelson brought Santa Gertrudis to the Forked Light\u00adning it was the first time the breed was win\u00adtered at high alti\u00adtude. A tire\u00adless pro\u00admoter of the breed, Mr. Foge\u00adlson was the first to ex\u00adhibit San\u00adta G\u00adertr\u00adudis at the New Mex\u00adico State Fair in 1961.    Mr. Fogelson died in 1987 and the Forked Lightning was divided along the old southern boundary line of Tex's original Forked Light\u00adning. Greer Garson Fogelson re\u00adceived the \"old\" Forked Lightning Ranch and Mr. Fogelson's son inher\u00adited the southern portion. In January 1991, Mrs. Foge\u00adlson sold the Forked Light\u00adning to The Con\u00adservation Fund, which donated it to the National Park Service to be\u00adcome part of Pecos National His\u00adtori\u00adcal Park.     The ranch house has remained rela\u00adtively unchanged. Tex's Forked Light\u00adning brand still marks the origi\u00adnal fixtures in the living and dining rooms and the steer head still stares down the Pecos. It is not difficult to imagine the fa\u00admous and not so famous gath\u00adered around the huge fireplace, sip\u00adping drinks on the wide front porch, or enjoying the sun on the patio, all basking in the warm atmosphere that wel\u00adcomed so many guests for more than 60 years.    \u00a0    Greer Garson as Madame Curie; Dec. 20, 1943 Time Magazine.    \u00a0    Winter view from front porch of Forked Lightning Ranch looking towards Pecos River.
