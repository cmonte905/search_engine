{"body": "Pinon-Juniper Woodlands and Savannahs         Coyotes find plentiful food with the cottontail rabbits, pi\u00f1on mice, and pocket gophers in the Pi\u00f1on-Juniper Woodland supplemented by the occasional roadkill elk. Photo by Sally King  Once you move up in elevation from the Rio Grande and canyon-bottom streams, you will find pi\u00f1on-juniper woodlands and savannahs. Pi\u00f1on pine and juniper trees live here because they are well adapted to drought conditions. This plant community provides essential food for the pi\u00f1on jay, cottontail rabbits, and pi\u00f1on mice. With its calorie-rich nuts, the pi\u00f1on pine provided an important though sporadic ingredient in the Ancestral Pueblo diet. Junipers provided edible berries and durable wood for tool-making.  \u00a0     A sunny rock in the Pi\u00f1on-Juniper Woodland is a good place to spot an Eastern Fence Lizard displaying his colors. Photo by Sally King  Soil erosion is a major problem in this zone due to past practices of livestock overgrazing and fire suppression. Severe droughts in the early 2000s caused large-scale die-offs of these trees across the Pajarito Plateau. These two factors have dramatically altered the pi\u00f1on-juniper communities in Bandelier.
