NPS Photo  A Cooperative Approach to Fire The 2009 San Miguel Wildland Fire represents an evolution in federal fire policy.  \u201cManaging fire is about more than fighting fire,\u201d said Bandelier National Monument Superintendent Jason Lott.  \u201cOur goal is to allow lighting-ignited fires to burn naturally within fire-adapted ecosystems when we can do so safely, effectively, and efficiently,\u201d said Lott.  \u201cFire and smoke are an inevitable part of living in New Mexico,\u201d said Bandelier National Monument Fire Management Officer Gary Kemp.  \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of if they occur, but when,\u201d he continued.    \u201cEvery fire is different, and we evaluate the potential risks and benefits of each one,\u201d said Lott. Numerous fires started in the Jemez Mountains during the first week of July.  Of those new starts, all but two were suppressed.  \u201cWe decided to manage the San Miguel Wildland Fire for resource benefits based on guidance outlined in our fire management plan, in combination with an analysis of the current situation,\u201d Kemp explained.    \u00a0     The scenic overlook on the Monument\u2019s entrance road, gave visitors an opportunity to discuss and learn about the ecological benefits of natural fire from Park Rangers. NPS Photo  \u201cIt all comes down to when, where, and why,\u201d says Lott.  This fire started in early July, after the area had received substantial precipitation, and during a time when fire resources were readily available.  The fire is located in a fire-adapted ecosystem within the remote Bandelier Wilderness where it poses no immediate risk to life, safety, property, or resources.  The fire is also surrounded by rocky terrain, trails, and previously burned areas, which all serve as natural fuel breaks.  The San Miguel Wildland fire is playing an essential role in clearing out dead and down vegetation on the forest floor, setting the stage for new plant growth and helping slow the spread and intensity of large, intense wildfires in the future.    \u201cThe San Miguel Wildland Fire is an excellent example of our flexibility in managing wildfire,\u201d said Incident Commander Robert Morales.  \u201cWe were able to use a variety of tactics to limit the spread of the fire on a portion of the fire while continuing to manage the fire for resource objectives,\u201d he added. As the fire progressed, hotshot crews and water-dropping aircraft were brought in to limit the fire\u2019s spread to the north, east, and south, where it had the potential to move into thicker fuels that would have burned hotter and faster than desired, and would have produced significantly more smoke that would have lasted for a longer period.  \u201cWe focused our efforts on areas where firefighters could access the fire safely and where our resources would be most effective,\u201d Morales said.    From the onset of the fire, Bandelier National Monument Superintendent Jason Lott and Santa Fe National Forest Supervisor Daniel Jiron agreed to work together to manage fire for resource benefit as it progressed naturally from the Bandelier Wilderness into the Dome Wilderness on its western perimeter.  \u201cThis fire set the stage for future interagency fire management opportunities,\u201d Jiron emphasized.  \u00a0   \u201cWhile smoke impacts were present during the San Miguel Wildland Fire, variable winds resulted in intermittent, temporary impacts to nearby communities during the most active days of the fire,\u201d said Kemp.  \u201cWe always prioritize public health and safety when planning and managing wildland fire activities in the Monument,\u201d said Superintendent Jason Lott.  \u201cWe have a responsibility to balance short-term impacts with long-term benefits,\u201d he added.  Slow-moving, low to moderate intensity wildfires like the San Miguel Wildland Fire help reduce the future risk of large, destructive wildfires which can produce heavy smoke and impact communities for weeks.  \u201cFire managers on the San Miguel Wildland Fire are exceeding basic reporting requirements and working closely with the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) to strategize ways to ensure smoke management is a priority,\u201d stated Jim Norton, NMED Environmental Protection Division Director. \u201cWe intend to work closely together in the future to ensure that management of smoke remains a priority for all types of managed fires, including naturally ignited fires.\u201d  The San Miguel Wildland Fire burned 1,635 acres (1,442 acres on National Park Service, 192 acres on US Forest Service), and resulted in a mosaic of burned and unburned vegetation.  Fire activity has been minimal over the past few days and little growth is expected.  \u201cSome logs and stumps within the fire\u2019s perimeter will continue to smolder until extinguished naturally by rain,\u201d explained Kemp.  Final costs for the fire are not available, but early estimates show the cost of managing the San Miguel Wildland Fire are hundreds of dollars per acre less than a comparable prescribed fire or a full-suppression fire.    In the future, the National Park Service and the National Forest Service will continue to assess naturally occurring fires as they did the San Miguel Fire to determine if they can be managed for resource benefits or if they should be fully suppressed.  If a fire poses no threat to life, safety, property or resources, fire managers may allow it to follow its natural course and cleanse the landscape and renew vegetation.  Both agencies expect managed fires to be more of a norm within the Bandelier National Monument and the Santa Fe National Forest.
