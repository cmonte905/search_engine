Frank   \u00a0   Hiking in Dinosaur is an excellent way to appreciate the park's scenery and rugged landscape. The most popular trails begin near the visitor centers and the two paved tour roads. Other trails begin at more remote locations. Remember that you are in the desert! Bring plenty of water, a good sun hat and sunscreen. Make sure someone knows where you are going and when you are due back, especially if you are hiking in a remote area. Pets are not allowed on most trails or in the backcountry. Please make arrangements for your pets before planning to hike within the monument.   \u00a0      Quarry and Cub Creek Area Trails (Utah Portion of the Monument)   Fossil Discovery Trail (1.2 miles) River Trail (2 miles)   Sound of Silence Trail (3 miles) Box Canyon Trail (\u00bd mile)   Desert Voices Trail (1\u00bd miles) Hog Canyon Trail (1\u00bd miles)   Harpers Corner Road Area Trails (Colorado Portion of the Monument)   Cold Desert Trail (\u00bd mile) Ruple Point Trail (4\u00be miles)   Plug Hat Trail (\u00bc mile - accessible) Harpers Corner Trail (1\u00bd miles)   Remote Trails     Bull Canyon Trail (1.5 miles) Gates of Lodore Trail (\u00be mile)   Island Park Trail (8 miles)  Jones Hole Trail (4\u00bc miles)     \u00a0   Off-trail hiking Unlike many national park areas, off trail hiking is permitted in Dinosaur National Monument.
