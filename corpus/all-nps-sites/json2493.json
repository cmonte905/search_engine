The Grand Canyon Museum Collection is a storage and research facility dedicated to preserving the physical artifacts that tell the various aspects of the Grand Canyon story. The storage facility, completed in 1999, has over 6,000 square feet of climate-controlled storage and research space, and houses over 900,000 objects from seven different disciplines: archeology, ethnology, history, archive/ manuscripts, biology, geology and paleontology. Staff receive more than 2,000 research requests each year. The Grand Canyon Museum Collection is open for study and research purposes to any interested researcher. In order to maintain its integrity, the collection may be used for reference only in a non-consumptive manner.  Museum staff must be present and will assist visitors in their searches. Because objects are irreplaceable, their use is generally restricted to onsite examination.   \u00a0   Collections  \u00a0   The Archeology Collections:  The material remains of past human life and activities at Grand Canyon, including: \u2022        Lithic tools dating back 12,000 years to the Paleo-Indians \u2022        Archaic split- twig figurines \u2022        Prehistoric basketry \u2022        Ancestral Puebloan pottery \u2022        Prehistoric sandals, textiles and adornment artifacts \u2022        Mining and early tourism artifacts  \u00a0      \u00a0     The Ethnology Collections:  \u00a0      The material artifacts of the native cultures that have inhabited the Grand Canyon region from the historic period through the present, including: \u2022        Havasupai baskets \u2022        Hopi kachinas, pottery, baskets \u2022        Navajo silver, rugs, pottery \u2022        Paiute baskets \u2022        Ethnobotanical materials  \u00a0     The History Collections:  \u00a0      Non-archeological material artifacts of the non-native cultures at Grand Canyon, including:   John Wesley Powell's pocket watch The Walter Clement Powell diaries from the second Powell expedition A pen used by Woodrow Wilson to sign the act creating Grand Canyon National Park in 1919 Photos from the 1873 George Wheeler expedition Over 200 oral history tapes, videos and transcripts Over 1,000 maps and blueprints More than 20,000 black and white photographs Over 200 rare or out-of-print books Over 80 hours of historic film footage Original paintings by Thomas Moran, Louis Akin, Gunnar Widforss, Hiroshi Yoshida   \u00a0      The Historic Boat Conservation Project The Grand Canyon historic boat collection is comprised of 19 boats that comprehensively illustrate the history of river running on the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon, with the oldest boat dating back to 1909.
