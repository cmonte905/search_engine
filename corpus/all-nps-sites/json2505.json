such as hiking uphill in Grand Canyon - you can lose as much as two quarts of water per hour?\u00a0 Did you also know that the human body is only capable of absorbing about one quart of water per hour?\u00a0 Every time we breathe we exhale water vapor, and let\u2019s not forget how much we sweat when exerting ourselves!\u00a0 Between respiration, sweating, and urination, our bodies have the potential to lose far more water than we can physically replenish.\u00a0 This is why it is very important that we try our best to stay hydrated during a Grand Canyon hike by constantly drinking water.\u00a0 One of the best ways to stay hydrated is to use a backpack-style hydration system which has a hose straw allowing you to easily access your water, even while hiking!\u00a0 Be aware that potable water is not always available, even in expected locations.\u00a0 A water filter or purification tablets are essential pieces of equipment for all canyon hikers.\u00a0 Hikers should also be aware that balancing water intake with electrolytes and food is important to maintaining proper body function.\u00a0 Alternating water with electrolyte supplements and salty foods will help balance the two and avoid a problem called water intoxication.\u00a0 But remember, it doesn\u2019t matter how much food and water your body receives if it cannot cool itself sufficiently.\u00a0 So be sure to watch your timing and rest during the heat of the day.Water is also an important tool hikers can use to regulate body temperature.\u00a0 Serious and sometimes fatal illnesses such as heat stroke occur because our body heats to a temperature which no longer allows internal organs to properly function.\u00a0 However, heat stroke can be prevented by staying well hydrated and keeping your core temperature as close to normal as possible.\u00a0 One way to regulate body temperature is to soak yourself with water as often as possible, focusing on cooling the body\u2019s high temperature areas such as your head, feet, hands, underarms, and groin.\u00a0 When safe water conditions are available, completely immersing yourself in water is a great way to cool the body as well.\u00a0 Keep in mind, though, that swimming in the Colorado River is dangerous and never recommended due to the existence of extremely strong currents.\u00a0 If the Colorado River is the only water around, be sure to avoid the main current and act with caution.\u00a0 If available, smaller streams and creeks are a better source of cooling water.\u00a0 Hike wet as often as you can and take breaks in the shade whenever it is available.\u00a0 All of these techniques will help you stay as cool as possible while hiking in the hot canyon air.Eating:\u00a0 Are you one of those folks (much like myself) who loves any excuse to eat tasty foods?\u00a0 Well have I got a treat for you!\u00a0 It is really important to balance your water consumption with salts and carbohydrates.\u00a0 What does this mean?\u00a0 Your body needs you to eat a lot more food than you do on any other day that you are not hiking in Grand Canyon.\u00a0 Typically, in order to remain properly fueled, a Grand Canyon hiker needs to consume at least twice as many calories as they would when not hiking.\u00a0 In addition, our bodies are losing salts and electrolytes at an exponential rate while hiking in such extreme heat.\u00a0 It is important to not only fuel with carbohydrates, but also to consume enough salt to balance the amount we are losing.\u00a0 Some of the best foods to replace salts are not necessarily things we would automatically assume are good \u201ctrail foods.\u201d\u00a0 For example, when I hike I love to take potato chips in a can, cheese crackers, salted nuts, cheese, pretzels, jerky or summer sausage, and sandwich crackers with peanut butter or cheese.\u00a0 The bottom line for me is that I lose my appetite when I am hot, so bringing foods that will sustain me with proteins and carbohydrates and replenish my salts means carrying foods that I am going to want to eat.\u00a0 Find your favorite snacks that have carbs, proteins, and salts and carry them while hiking, remembering to eat each time you stop to rest.Efficiency:\u00a0 There are many factors that contribute to an efficient hike.\u00a0 Whether you are a day hiker or overnight backpacker, efficiently choosing your hiking essentials can make a world of difference, especially in the extreme summer heat.\u00a0 The idea here is to keep your pack as light as possible while still maintaining essential items.\u00a0 Food and water should be the heaviest items in your pack, not unnecessary equipment.\u00a0 You can easily reduce your pack weight by bringing foods that do not need to be cooked - eliminating a stove and fuel, and carrying a sheet instead of a sleeping bag.\u00a0 Using lightweight trekking poles can relieve up to 25% of the force exerted on your knees during a hike.\u00a0 In Grand Canyon, that is a lot of relief for your knees!\u00a0 Trekking poles also help maintain balance and distribute weight more evenly on the body.\u00a0 So remember, while you should never hike without the essentials, a lighter pack weight can translate to a world of relief during hot summer hiking.Temperature:\u00a0 During the summer months, high temperatures can affect everything we do.\u00a0 Heat can create miserable hiking conditions, and who wants to hike and be miserable?\u00a0 High temperatures in the inner canyon during summer can reach upwards of 110 degrees Fahrenheit in the shade.\u00a0 Add another ten to twenty degrees for temperatures taken in direct sunlight.\u00a0  What does this mean for hikers?\u00a0 Excessive heat is not only uncomfortable but inflicts unnecessary stress on your mind and body and can cause serious illness such as dehydration, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke.\u00a0 Extremely high temperatures can also create conditions which eliminate a lifeline for help in cases of serious illness or injury.\u00a0 When hikers become ill or injured in the canyon there are only two options for evacuation: hike yourself out \u2013 otherwise known as \u201cself-rescue,\u201d or medical evacuation such as by helicopter.\u00a0 However, hikers should never expect a medical evacuation.\u00a0 Extreme summer temperatures can cause thin and unstable air in the canyon \u2013 conditions in which helicopters cannot fly.\u00a0 If conditions allow for evacuation of a seriously ill or injured hiker, chances are that hiker will then be flown to the nearest hospital, a flight which can cost around $15,000.\u00a0  Instead of relying on any form of evacuation from the canyon, you should be as proactive as possible and hike only when temperatures are tolerable for you and your body.\u00a0 If you take the unnecessary risk of hiking when it is too hot, it may cost you a small fortune, your health, or your life.Hiking Grand Canyon brings immense challenges year-round including elevation, desert environments, and wildly varying temperatures.\u00a0 Attempting canyon hikes in extreme summer conditions adds to this complexity.\u00a0 So remember, the next time you decide to brave Grand Canyon\u2019s high summer temperatures, Hike Smart by remembering \u201cTWEET\u201d during your hike.\u00a0 Paying close attention to Timing, Water, Eating, Efficiency, and Temperature can determine whether you have a safe and enjoyable experience, or one that is hot, uncomfortable, and potentially fatal.\u00a0 The Backcountry Information Center does not want you to become a statistic, so take care of yourself while hiking in the summer, and always remember \u201cTWEET\u201d to beat the heat!   \u00a0   Two Short Slide Shows About Hiking.    \u00a0         Day Hiking Slide Show: 03min:11sec (No Audio)   Loading the player...
