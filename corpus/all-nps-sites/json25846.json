{"body": "Seed Study - Seed Collection       The year that we collected seed for this study was unfortunately part of a prolonged drought. Collection was difficult because some species from which we wanted to collect seed did not grow at all, were hard to find, or did not produce seed. Another problem was heavy predation by insects and wildlife. These facts should be kept in mind when using the data below. After we collected seed, we cleaned it to the point necessary for hand broadcast seeding. We then weighed the bulk amount of each species that we had. To translate this into number of seeds, we took five small subsamples from each species. For each subsample, we weighed the bulk amount, and then separated out the ripe, filled, undamaged seed. We counted these good seeds to give us an idea of the number of seeds per unit mass of material that we would hand broadcast in our experimental plots. For some species we also weighed these clean seeds for information on individual seed mass. To access information on an individual species, go to the species table. Definitions/explanations of each of the terms used in the species seed collection information are below. Average number of good seeds per gram bulk matter: Average number of seeds per gram of bulk matter, as measured in five subsamples. Number in parentheses following average is standard deviation. Average number of good seeds per gram cleaned: Average number of seeds per gram of pure seed, separated from chaff, stems, leaves, etc., from five subsamples. Note that this is not necessarily PLS (pure live seed), as we do not have information on seed viability for many species. Number in parentheses following average is standard deviation. Commercial estimates of seeds per gram: Values come from a variety of sources, including Natural Resource Conservation Service technical guides, commercial catalogs, and National Park Service native species propagation documents. Keep in mind that these values are for very clean seed compared to what we were measuring (e.g., awns from needle grasses removed). Percent seed: pure seed mass/bulk seed mass X 100%, where pure seed mass is the weight (in grams) of the good seed, free of chaff, stems, etc. from a subsample, and bulk seed mass is the weight (in grams) of the seed matter cleaned to the state of planting by hand broadcast seeding (usually includes chaff, some small leaves, etc.). Percent live: percent of seed that was viable, as measured by South Dakota State University Seed Laboratory. Collection dates: Dates that we collected seed at Wind Cave National Park, southwestern South Dakota, foothills of the Black Hills, in 2004. Many species matured late this year because of a late spurt of moisture after dry conditions early in the summer. Collection effort: A very rough estimation of how much time it took to collect the given mass of bulk seed for a species. Estimates are rough because we often were collecting many species at the same time. \"n.m.\" means not measured; \"n.a.\" means not available  Achillea millefolium \u2013 common yarrow Amorpha canescens \u2013 leadplant Andropogon gerardii \u2013 big bluestem Anemone cylindrica \u2013 candle anemone, thimbleweed Aristida purpurea \u2013 red three awn Artemisia frigida \u2013 fringed sagewort Artemisia ludoviciana \u2013 white sage, man sage Asclepias speciosa \u2013 showy milkweed Bouteloua curtipendula - sideoats grama Bouteloua gracilis \u2013 blue grama Bouteloua hirsuta \u2013 hairy grama Brickellia eupatorioides \u2013 false boneset Calylophus serrulatus \u2013 yellow evening primrose Cirsium undulatum \u2013 wavyleaf thistle Dalea purpurea \u2013 purple prairie clover Dyssodia papposa \u2013 fetid marigold Echinacea angustifolia \u2013 purple coneflower Elymus elymoides \u2013 squirreltail bottlebrush Erysimum asperum \u2013 western wallflower Gaura coccinea \u2013 scarlet gaura Glycyrrhiza lepidota \u2013 wild licorice Grindelia squarrosa \u2013 curlycup gumweed Gutierrezia sarothrae \u2013 broom snakeweed Helianthus annuus \u2013 common sunflower Hesperostipa comata \u2013 needle and thread Heterotheca villosa \u2013 hairy false golden aster Ipomoea leptophylla \u2013 bush morningglory Koeleria macrantha \u2013 prairie junegrass Liatris punctata \u2013 dotted gayfeather Lithospermum incisum \u2013 narrowleaf gromwell Monarda fistulosa \u2013 bee balm, horse mint Nassella viridula \u2013 green needlegrass Oligoneuron rigidum \u2013 stiff goldenrod Onosmodium molle \u2013 false gromwell Pascopyrum smithii \u2013 western wheatgrass Penstemon grandiflorus \u2013 large beardtongue Plantago patagonica \u2013 wooly plantain Psoralidium tenuiflorum \u2013 slimflower scurfpea Ratibida columnifera \u2013 prairie coneflower Rosa arkansana \u2013 prairie wild rose Schizachyrium scoparium \u2013 little bluestem Solidago missouriensis \u2013 prairie goldenrod Solidago nemoralis \u2013 gray goldenrod Sporobolus cryptandrus \u2013 sand dropseed Symphoricarpos occidentalis \u2013 western snowberry Symphyotrichum ericoides \u2013 heath aster Verbena bracteata \u2013 prostrate vervain Verbena stricta \u2013 hoary vervain", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/wica/learn/nature/seed-study-seed-collection.htm", "title": "Wind Cave National Park: Seed Collection"}
