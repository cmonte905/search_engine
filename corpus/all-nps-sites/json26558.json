Lewis for the CarTours Foundation. The 50-minute audio program includes journal readings, sounds and music of the Corps of Discovery and voices of Clatsop and Chinook tribal members, descendants of the native people who helped the explorers make through the winter 200 years ago.  Material was also pulled from the \"Trail of Discovery\" series of audio programs exploring the Lewis and Clark story along the Columbia River, 1805 - 1806, which was produced by the CarTours Foundation in partnership with the National Park Service at Fort Clatsop (and is on sale in the bookshop at the Visitor Center). Much of the music for the new audio tour was performed by Daniel Slosberg, well known along the Lewis and Clark Trail as Pierre Cruzatte, the one-eyed boatman and principal fiddler with the expedition. Many of the natural sounds used in the production were recorded within the Park for authenticity.
