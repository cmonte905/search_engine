He, seeing so hopeful a youth, took such liking to him that he sent him into Sutton's Hospital.\" - A handwritten note by Mrs. Anne Sadleir, eldest daughter Roger Williams\u2019s patron and mentor  Sir Edward Coke  Roger was born in London England about 1603 and was christened at St. Sepulcher Church. The exact date of his birth is unknown because the church\u2019s parish records were destroyed during the Great London Fire of 1666. Roger\u2019 father, James Williams, was a successful merchant tailor. He left his family comfortably situated after his death in 1621. Roger\u2019s mother, Alice Pemberton, ran a successful inn in London and died in 1634. Alice left an inheritance to Roger and his wife Mary who were by that time \u2018across the seas.\u2019  Roger had an older brother, Sydrach, an older sister, Catherine, and a younger brother, Robert. Though financially comfortable, Roger\u2019s family fell low in the \u201cGreat Chain of Being.\u201d This ranking system was believed to hold the universe together. Everything on earth was ranked in its order of importance. Merchants fell below Priests, Squires, and Pages. But they were above farmers, soldiers, and servants. The Great Chain severely limited one\u2019s social mobility. It was considered not only improper to disrupt this order, but also dangerous to all existence. Much of Roger\u2019s early years remain unknown. We do know that he taught himself shorthand, the new method for writing and recording the spoken word verbatim. This skill attracted the attention of Sir Edward Coke. At that time Coke was the chief justice of the king\u2019s bench. Coke was the prosecutor in the Sir Walter Raleigh and Guy Fawkes trials. A jurist and prolific law writer, Coke was unafraid to challenge royal power and is still considered an eminent figure in the history of English law.  Coke recognized Roger\u2019s talents, intelligence, and potential. He sponsored Roger\u2019s education at Sutton\u2019s Hospital, also known as Charterhouse school. Charterhouse was founded by Thomas Sutton in 1611 as a hospital for \u201csuch as had been servants to the Kings Majesty . . .\u201d  It was also a school for \u2018persons distinguished either by their high birth, dignified situation or splendid talents.\u2019 At Charterhouse, students were \u2018fed, clothed and instructed in classical learning, writing and arithmetic at the sole expense of the charity.\u201d   Roger excelled in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. He was one of eight students granted a scholarship to Pembroke College at Cambridge University. There he received his A.B. in 1627. To this day, Pembroke still recognizes Roger Williams as one of its outstanding 17th century students. In 1629 Roger was ordained as a minister in the Church of England. He accepted the post of chaplain to Sir William Masham\u2019s manor house at Otes in Essex. There he courted Jane Whalley. This courtship was brought to an abrupt end by Jane\u2019s aunt Lady Barrington, who felt that Roger\u2019s social status as a minister was not equal to their noble blood. Overcome by the rejection, Roger fell ill. Mary Barnard, a member of Lady Masham\u2019s household, nursed him back to health. Roger and Mary were married at All Saints Church, High Laver in Essex on December 15, 1629. Roger became increasingly dissatisfied with the Church of England. He felt they were moving closer and closer in substance and style to the Roman Catholic Church.  Roger\u2019s own beliefs were better aligned with those of the Puritans who wanted to simplify and purify the Church of England. But this was a dangerous time for those who challenged the Church of England. Under King James I (1603-1625) and increasingly under King Charles I (1625-1649) religious dissent was dealt with harshly, including by execution. In 1630 the first mass exodus of Puritans left England. Under John Winthrop approximately 1000 Puritans sailed for what was to become the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Roger and his wife Mary followed shortly thereafter.  \u00a0      Back to \"Roger's Life\" Next to \"Rejecting the Middle Way\"", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/rowi/learn/historyculture/youth.htm", "title": "Roger Williams National Memorial: Youth & Education"}
