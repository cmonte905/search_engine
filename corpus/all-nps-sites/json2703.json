{"body": "Virtual Tour          On this page you will find two different types of content, Quicktime VR (QTVR) Movies and JPEG Panoramic Images.  (QTVR) movies allow viewers to scan right and left and in most cases all the way around. They provide a way of getting an overall impression of a scene and not just one static view. There are two ways to view each QTVR. The first is by left clicking on the link. Doing that will cause the page to change and the movie to open in the new page. The second way is by right clicking on the link and then selecting \"Save Target As\". This will allow you save each QTVR to your own computer. Once saved you will be able to open each QTVR in a seperate Quicktime window on your computer.   Once open, all you have to do is hold down the mouse on the image and drag to the right or left to pan around. Use the + and - buttons to zoom in and out. The same to two options hold ture for viewing the JPEG Imgaes. Please be aware that these images are very large files and they may take a while to download depending on your connection speed. You can also see these images in our Photo Gallery. Please note that you will need the latest version of Apple's QuickTime software to view the QTVR Movies below. If you do not have the latest version click here to download it for free.  \u00a0    The Parking Lot & Visitor Center  \u00a0      View Of The Visitor Center And Parking Lot QTVR Movie (3.03Mb) JPEG Image (5.52Mb)  \u00a0    After a long drive on the interstate you arrive at Montezuma Castle National Monument.\u00a0 You park the car, stretch your legs and walk the short distance to the Visitor Center.\u00a0 As you do so you smell the good desert air, see the incredible white-barked Sycamore trees and think that this is going to be a special visit.    \u00a0      View From Inside The Visitor Center QTVR Movie (1.62Mb) JPEG Image (3.44Mb)  \u00a0    After stopping at the bathroom, you step inside the Visitor Center.\u00a0 You pay your fee, get a brochure and start having fun!\u00a0 On the counter is a display about animal tracks and in front of you a picture of the prehistoric ruin you are about to see.\u00a0 As you turn to the left you see the myriad books the Western National Parks Association has for sale and a media station where you can take a virtual tour of the inside of the Castle.    \u00a0      View From Inside The Museum QTVR Movie (1.44Mb) JPEG Image (2.91Mb)  \u00a0    Before starting on the trail you decide to walk through the museum, since the ranger at the front desk said it would be a good orientation.\u00a0 The panels give you a good reference point for what was going on in the western world, when the Sinagua culture was building in central Arizona.\u00a0 You also see artifacts from the Sinagua and from affiliated tribes.    \u00a0     The Montezuma Castle Trail  \u00a0      View From The Trail Split QTVR Movie (3.34Mb) JPEG Image (6.56Mb)  \u00a0    As you started down the trail you took time to enjoy the Arizona sycamores once again and to wonder at the hillside to your right.\u00a0 Now, straight in front of you is the split in the trail where the loop portion starts.\u00a0 Even more exciting is what the hillside to your right reveals at this juncture: your first view of Montezuma Castle!\u00a0 It\u2019s so high!\u00a0 As you continue turning right you see the trail you\u2019ve already walked behind you, and the desert plant life that helped sustain the Sinagua.    \u00a0      View From The Interpretive Circle Below Montezuma Castle QTVR Movie (3.38Mb) JPEG Image (6.88Mb)  \u00a0    You continued down the trail and stood right in front of the Castle for pictures.\u00a0 Now you\u2019ve walked just a bit further to the Interpretive Circle where Rangers give talks on Sinaguan artifacts and nature found at Montezuma Castle National Monument.\u00a0 As you turn to see where the best seat for the program will be, you realize that you are standing in a flood plain from Beaver Creek.\u00a0 Good thing it\u2019s not flooding now!
