{"body": "Recreation in Wilderness Areas            Keep up-to-date about Lake Mead NRA  by following us via our social media sites:             \u00a0            Wilderness areas are managed in such a way that they are unhindered and free from intentional modern human control or manipulation. In other words, the imprint of humans goes largely unnoticed. This is achieved by encouraging primitive recreation, minimal tool allowances and enhancing the naturalness of an area. Change occurs generally by natural disturbance only.   Wilderness units offer the chance to seek remoteness, freedom, risk, and the physical and emotional challenges of self-discovery and self-reliance. Nature takes the lead and humans follow when journeying into the wild.
