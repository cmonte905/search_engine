Through these relationships, the park has received valuable assistance in the form of educational programs, living history demonstrations, fundraising campaigns, habitat restoration, ecosystem management, and a host of other activities. These relationships \u2013 generally referred to as \u201cpartnerships\u201d \u2013 have produced countless benefits for the area parks, including Charles Pinckney National Historic Site.
