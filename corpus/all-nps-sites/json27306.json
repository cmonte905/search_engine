By early May 1780 they took Savannah, Georgia, and the two largest communities in SC, Charleston and Camden.\u00a0 The Patriot situation in the South was desperate with only Francis Marion, Thomas Sumter, and other partisan leaders in the field still holding out against the British.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This situation did not last, however.\u00a0 General Washington ordered General Nathanael Greene to the South in December 1780 to command the Southern Continental army.\u00a0 In a masterful maneuver, he split his army, taking part of it himself to the Cheraw, South Carolina, area to put pressure on the British post at Camden, and sending General Daniel Morgan and his Flying Army west and south of the Broad River to \u201cspirit up the people,\u201d and forage for food.\u00a0  Believing Morgan\u2019s movements a threat to the British post at Ninety-Six and to area Loyalists, Cornwallis sent Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton after him.\u00a0 The fast-moving Tarleton and his army marched for eleven days crossing the rain-swollen Enoree, Tyger, and Pacolet Rivers in their move to confront Morgan and possibly drive him into Cornwallis\u2019s hands in the area of Kings Mountain.\u00a0 Learning that Tarleton was moving in his direction, Morgan left his encampment at Grindal Shoals on the Pacolet River and began moving west on an old wagon road leading to the Green River in North Carolina.\u00a0  Morgan, afraid Tarleton would overtake him as he turned north and forded the rain-swollen Broad River into North Carolina, stopped at the Cowpens, a frontier pasturing area and well-known landmark in the upper Pacolet River watershed. The response for his call for area militia made it possible for him to make a stand at the Cowpens.\u00a0 Many militia had joined him at Grindal Shoals, but more responded to the call of \u201ccome to the Cow pens.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Although Tarleton had the edge in veteran troops under this command, Morgan had the advantage of being able to choose where their battle would take place. On January 16, Morgan rode his horse over the site alongside local resident Dennis Trammel. Like the Cherokee and Shawnee he had encountered in the French and Indian War, Morgan came to know the landscape and would use it to his advantage.\u00a0 Incorporating slightly rolling terrain with subtle hillocks and low places that could conceal mounted horsemen, a forest floor cleared of undergrowth by foraging cattle, and the most welcome arrival of some three-hundred militia under Colonel Andrew Pickens, Morgan devised a battle plan that was both simple and effective.\u00a0 The plan relied heavily on Banastre Tarleton\u2019s impetuosity, and as we will learn as you take this driving tour, Morgan\u2019s men carried it out almost to perfection.\u00a0 Begin the battlefield auto tour by driving to the back of the parking lot and turning left onto the tour road.\u00a0 Stop at the first paved pull-off to your left to learn about early Carolina cattle culture, important to the local and regional economy at the time of the battle.         \u00a0          Loop Road Audio Tour Stop 1    This is an audio tour of the auto loop road, narrated by Edwin C.

In this Native Americans played a role; they often created prairies by periodically burning land for hunting purposes.\u00a0  Early settlers knew a good \u201cIndian old field\u201d when they saw one and often used such areas for cattle grazing purposes.\u00a0 The site here was one such area:\u00a0 As the largest cow pens in the upcountry, it was known as \u201cthe Cowpens.\u201d The name \u201ccow pens\u201d has disappeared from most sites, but the decisive battle fought\u00a0 here has made the name part of the history books for all time.\u00a0          \u00a0          Loop Road Audio Tour Stop 2    This is an audio tour of the auto loop road, narrated by Edwin C.

Look for the sign for Nature trail Parking to begin the hike. Hardwoods such as oaks and hickories dominate the forest along the creek, and rare plants grow in places.\u00a0  If you decide to walk, please stay on the trail and allow enough time to complete your walk.\u00a0 You may want to take water and also use insect repellant in warm seasons. As you walk, you can imagine what this area was like in 1781. Old-growth trees grew to great dimensions and heights, their huge canopies towering above. Forests were often composed of widely-spaced trees, giving the landscape a park-like appearance. Huge oaks, hickories, pines dominated the forest and field landscape at Cow pens. Also part of the forest composition was the once-abundant American Chestnut, which has virtually disappeared, falling victim to a blight in the earlier part of the 20th century.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  It is a myth, however, to believe all eastern American appeared so park-like; the land was sometimes a patchwork quilt of various landscape compositions\u2014storms, differences in soil composition,\u00a0 wildfires, and native use of fire for hunting purposes accounted for fields and forest in various stages of growth.\u00a0  In addition to forests, imagine also interspersed grasslands, which provided habitat for ground-nesting birds such as quail, field sparrows, and meadowlarks and a diversity of grasses, wildflowers, insects, and small mammals.\u00a0 The fact that such grasslands are disappearing across the region, make those at Cowpens ever more important. Native river cane, forming extensive canebrakes, grew in wetland areas and provided food and habitat for wildlife and also building materials for Native Americans. European, however prized canebrakes for the rich soil they grew in.\u00a0 They grazed cattle in the canebrakes and eventually overgrazed and plowed many to oblivion. Butter from cows grazed in the canebrakes was said to be some of the best.\u00a0 Native cane remains in the park along streams and in wetland areas, but it is not nearly abundant and tall as it would have been in 1781.\u00a0 \u00a0          \u00a0          Loop Road Audio Tour Stop 3    This is an audio tour of the auto loop road, narrated by Edwin C.

The cabin was enlarged, siding was added, and a fireplace and chimney added to the west side.\u00a0 The enlargement was needed since the family raised 13 children.\u00a0 Robert Scruggs also was a successful merchant, and by 1850 had added about 750 acres to his land-holdings. The Robert Scruggs family and their descendants lived on the land and served as community leaders for some 175 years.\u00a0 A member of the family, the late Rosa Scruggs Garrett, still lived in the 1828 structure when the National Park Service acquired the property in the late 1970s. Practically ever since the Scruggs House was built it and the family have been closely associated with the Battle of the Cowpens.\u00a0 Even after the battle had been officially recognized by the federal government in 1929 members of the family acted as hosts for visitors until the Park Service opened the first staff visitors center in 1978.\u00a0 The Scruggs House had at least one noted visitor in its early years. In 1848, journalist and historian Benson Lossing visited the Scruggs family and observed the battlefield.\u00a0 Lossing was not impressed with the landscape.\u00a0 He wrote that the site of\u00a0 the battle was \u201camong the hills of Thicketty Mountain, and near the plantation of Robert Scruggs. The field was covered with blasted pines, stumps, and stocks of Indian corn, and had a most dreary appearance\u201dThe Scruggs House stands today restored to its original appearance, now in a pleasing setting that runs counter to Lossing\u2019s early description.\u00a0  The house is a reminder of\u00a0 the Scruggs family of other pioneering families in the region, and frontier log architecture.\u00a0           \u00a0          Loop Road Audio Tour Stop 4    This is an audio tour of the auto loop road, narrated by Edwin C.

As they formed, Morgan\u2019s first line of militia, the sharpshooters, were waiting, positioned across the same road on a slight slope 100 or more yards to the west of the British. The crack of their rifles broke the early morning stillness and drew the British into battle. Tarleton\u2019s order to his Dragoons to dislodge the skirmishers failed, but, as his infantry advanced the skirmishers gave way, as Morgan had planned and fell back to join the militia on the second line of defense. Now, it was the second militia line\u2019s turn to face the British.\u00a0 At least one unit in second line, that of Thomas Brandon, got off two volleys against the British as Morgan had earlier instructed, but most had time for only one before they retreated as planned to reform behind the Continental troops and Virginia militia, which was the third line.\u00a0 \u00a0 Seeing first the patriot sharpshooters and then the militia move back, the British vanguard mistakenly interpreted their withdrawal as a retreat and charged upslope directly into the sites of the Continentals and the Virginia militiamen. Tremendous firepower had already been directed at them by the two lines of militia.\u00a0 As the weakened British line continued its charge, the militia retreated as planned, the Continental line simply opening up, en echelon, to let them pass.\u00a0 They were far from safe, however; at this point Tarleton\u2019s horsemen broke through the Continental line after them, attempting to saber them from their elevated positions on horseback.\u00a0 It was at this point that William Washington and his 150 man Patriot cavalry, hidden in a swale and held in reserve for just such a moment, rode out to scatter the British horsemen and allow the militia to safely retreat and reform.\u00a0  As the Continental and British lines exchanged volleys, Tarleton brought up his own reserves, the 71st Scottish Highlanders, to strengthen the now-decimated British line and to outflank the Continentals to their right.\u00a0  This is where an unplanned event took place, which worked to favor the Patriots. The order for the Continentals to turn right to face the Highlanders was misunderstood and the entire Continental line began a mistaken, but orderly retreat, loading as they\u00a0 marched The Highlanders, seeing the militia run and now the Continentals, thought they had Morgan\u2019s army on the run.\u00a0 Breaking ranks, they charged after the Continentals, coming on, someone said, \u201clike a mob.\u201d But William Washington with the Patriot Cavalry saw what was happening and informed Daniel Morgan.\u00a0 When they closed to within 30 yards, Morgan, accompanying Colonel Howard on horseback, shouted, \u201cFace about boys.\u00a0 Give them one good fire and the victory is ours.\u201d\u00a0 The Continentals\u00a0 turned as one, firing from the hip as they did. The deadly fusillade killed or wounded dozens and threw the entire British force into confusion. Howard ordered a bayonet charge into the center of what remained of the Highlander line, while Washington\u2019s cavalry and Pickens\u2019 militia attacked their left and right flanks, respectively, trapping the British in what historians have called a double envelopment. The main British line, now weakened, began a surrender.\u00a0 Sensing a disaster, Tarleton attempted to rally his troops, but failed.\u00a0 Accompanied by a few of his officers, \u201cBloody Ban\u201d then made good an escape despite William Washington\u2019s valiant efforts to thwart the British commander. Leaving behind him 110 dead, 200 wounded, and about 600 taken prisoner, Tarleton outdistanced Washington down the Green River Road.\u00a0 Escaping with him were over 150 British cavalry.\u00a0 \u00a0 Tradition says that Tarleton took area resident Adam Goudelock captive to show him the route to Hamilton\u2019s Ford on the Broad River in his attempt to rendezvous with Cornwallis at his camp on Turkey Creek north of the Broad River.\u00a0 Mrs. Goudelock, afraid her husband would be harmed in a shoot-out, put the pursuing William Washington and his cavalry on the wrong road and Tarleton escaped.\u00a0 It was nighttime when Tarleton got to the Broad River, then at flood stage.\u00a0 When his soldiers expressed fear in crossing, Tarleton threatened to cut down any who hesitated.\u00a0 Reporting to Cornwallis the loss of an army was an unpleasant task.\u00a0 Cornwallis, however, needed Tarleton and the remnants of his army.\u00a0 Shortly, he began a pursuit of Morgan, and later General Nathanael Greene, that would lead him further into the Carolina backcountry, and away from his supplies.\u00a0          \u00a0          Loop Road Audio Tour Stop 5    This is an audio tour of the auto loop road, narrated by Edwin C.

His militia arrived with over 500 horses tied somewhere in the area.\u00a0 The area was a crossroads and he sent scouts on horseback in all directions.\u00a0 Tarleton, however, took the easiest approach\u2014coming in on the Green River Road from the southeast as Morgan had the day before.\u00a0 \u00a0 After the battle, Morgan dispatched Andrew Pickens and some militia to bury the dead and search for British stragglers.\u00a0 Morgan and his army, with the 600 prisoners, moved northwest on Island Ford Road toward Gilbert Town in Rutherford County, North Carolina, crossing the Broad River at Island Ford.\u00a0 His crossing of the Broad River was over twenty miles west of Tarleton\u2019s crossing.\u00a0  At Gilbert Town near Rutherford, Morgan sent the prisoners on ahead, escorted by militia. Eventually, they would be held in the Philadelphia area until the end of the war. After a few days at Gilbert Town, Morgan and his army moved northeast toward Ramseur\u2019s Mill. Cornwallis and his army, in pursuit, arrived at Ramseur\u2019s Mill two days after Morgan. Morgan, after a rendezvous with his commander, General Nathanael Greene, north of the Catawba River, was given a leave of absence because of some nagging health\u00a0 problems. General Greene led Cornwallis on a chase to the Dan River, separating North Carolina and Virginia.\u00a0 Taking boats he had made preparation for previously, he crossed that river into Virginia.\u00a0 There, his army rested and he recruited Virginia\u00a0 militia.\u00a0 He knew, however, he had to eventually face Cornwallis. Moving back into North Carolina, the two forces met at Guilford Courthouse. Although the British kept the field at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse, theirs was an empty victory. They lost men and officers and were essentially without supplies. From the Carolina backcountry, Cornwallis marched his army to Wilmington on the coast and eventually to Virginia, where he met defeat at Yorktown, October 19, 1781. Thus the road that ended at Yorktown began in the Cowpens.         \u00a0          Loop Road Audio Tour Conclusion    This is the conclusion to the audio auto loop road tour, narrated by Edwin C.
