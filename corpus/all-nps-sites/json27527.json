{"body": "Riding With Forrest         General Nathan Bedford Forrest   As a prisoner, William Holland was assigned to Dr. James Cowan, General Forrest\u2019s chief surgeon, as a \u201cwaitman\u201d or servant. Holland remained with Forrest\u2019s soldiers for three months, until after the Confederates were defeated at Franklin and Nashville. In early 1865, he somehow made it back to Union lines. Unfortunately, Holland did not leave any more details about his time riding with Forrest\u2019s raiders. We can only assume that he spent most of his time tending to the sick, dying and wounded and maybe to Dr. Cowan\u2019s personal needs. How Holland got away and rejoined his unit also remains a mystery.  \u00a0   NEXT PAGE", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/stri/learn/historyculture/holland4.htm", "title": "Stones River National Battlefield: Riding With Forrest"}
