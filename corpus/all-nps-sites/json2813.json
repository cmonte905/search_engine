The Hamblin-Cleopatra Volcano (HCV) was once a large stratovolcano and now has split into three large sections due to earthquake faults in the area. The volcano formed in the late Miocene time and through the years slowly split in half, and then parts of the Cleopatra section split again, separating the original volcano complex by twelve miles. The original volcano was more than 3,000 feet high and had a circular width of approximately eight miles. It\u2019s formation was rapid.

Other stratavolcanos are Mount Vesuvius in Italy, Mount St. Helens in Washington State, Mount Shasta in Northern California, and Mount Fuji in Japan.  \u00a0    History of Hamblin-Cleopatra   \u00a0      Around 13 million years ago, Hamblin-Cleopatra were one large stratovolcano. The volcano sat on the Hamblin Bay Fault which ran right through the middle of the mountain, splitting it in two. For clarity the Hamblin Mountain portion is in light red, the Cleopatra portion in light green, and the Cleopatra split-off is colored grey.  \u00a0      Over the millions of years since the volcano has been active the movement of the Hamblin Bay Fault moved the Hamblin portion to the southwest and the Cleopatra terrain to the northeast. Another fault formed that split the Cleopatra lobe in two.  \u00a0      Currently the Cleopatra lobe is around 12 miles from the Hamblin Mountain lobe.
