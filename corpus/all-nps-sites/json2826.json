They used cameras purchased with a grant funded through the National Park Foundation by the generous support of the Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr. Fund to produce 11 short videos about their visit. On the evening of May 27 we held the \u201cPark in Your Backyard\u201d film festival at the school. About 200 people were in attendance including students, family, faculty, community members, and park staff. Between Apr. 1 and the film premiere, rangers visited the school twice a week during and after school to assist students with putting together their films.", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/lake/learn/photosmultimedia/index.htm", "title": "Lake Mead National Recreation Area: Photos & Multimedia"}
