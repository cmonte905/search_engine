{"body": "2005 Songwriter Festival         Festival CD cover Western National Parks Association  Recognizing that music has been and continues to be an integral part of the visitor experience at park, a songwriter festival and contest was staged at Bromide Pavilion in October 2005. Songwriters from three states wrote and performed original works that interpreted the natural and historic resources of the park and captured the essence of very personal and profound experiences unique to the setting. Many musicians returned in June of 2006 to perform their original works again at the park's Centennial Celebration. A CD was produced from the live performance and a lyric booklet was written to accompany it. The CD is now a sales item at Travertine Nature Center and captures the spirit of the festival.  \u00a0   2005 Songwriter Festival \u2014 Celebrating 100 Years of Park History  Ghosts of the Chickasaw \u2014 Brenda Darnell; Lone Grove, Oklahoma The Chickasaw Calls Me Home \u2014 Sylvia Urech and Lewis Case; Dallas, Texas Kay-Yah Chickasaw \u2014 Dawn Anita Plumlee; Duncan, Oklahoma Waters of the Chickasaw \u2014 David Johnson; Walter, Oklahoma Family Reunion \u2014 Alan Fazier; Sulphur, Oklahoma Healin' Waters \u2014 Denny Spradling; Ardmore, Oklahoma Memories of a Chickasaw National Park \u2014 Jean Crawford; Broken Bow, Oklahoma A Mother's Night Song \u2014 Preston Edgar; Sulphur, Oklahoma Chickasaw National Park \u2014 Steve Wooten; Dibble, Oklahoma CNRA I Think I'll Stay \u2014 Kent Dakour; Ardmore, Oklahoma Chickasaw Wind \u2014 Gerald Kahlen; Durant, Oklahoma Take Me Back \u2014 Debbie Henning; Bethany, Oklahoma Arbuckle Mountains Where I Was Born \u2014 Gary Fullerton; Davis, Oklahoma Heart and Soul \u2014 Lauren Lee and Sawyer Lee; Holdenville, Oklahoma Haven \u2014 Clark Townsend; Bethany, Oklahoma", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/chic/learn/historyculture/song-writers-2005.htm", "title": "Chickasaw National Recreation Area: 2005 Songwriter Festival"}
