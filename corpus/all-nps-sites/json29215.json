There are many risks that you should be aware of. Using your common sense can usually keep you out of these situations.  \u00a0      Heat In the summertime, temperatures here at Chickasaw can reach over 100\u00ba F. If you are recreating anywhere in the park, listen to your body. You need to drink water, replenish electrolytes, and stay cool. Sodas and alcohol only dehydrate you. Keep your skin protected with light\u2013colored clothing, sunglasses, a hat, and sunscreen.  \u00a0      Weather Oklahoma is a land of extreme weather with possibilities ranging from hypothermia in the winter to heat stoke in the summer. Tornadoes and severe thunderstorms are also possible. Know what type of weather is forecast and be prepared. Keep a watch on the skies and be ready to get off the lake. Check park bulletin boards for the locations of city storm shelters.  \u00a0      Snakes In all national parks, wildlife is protected under law. This includes all 32 species of snakes found in this park. Of these 32 types, only 5 are poisonous and all are very beneficial. Be alert while recreating. If you see a snake, enjoy watching it from a distance. It is illegal to bother, touch, or try to kill them. Keeping away from snakes will help ensure your safety.  \u00a0      Wildlife Enjoying the great outdoors includes the many insects and animals as a part of the experience. There are a number of bugs in this healthy ecosystem that can bite or sting you. This includes, but is not limited to: spiders, ticks, bees, scorpions, leeches and fire ants. Take precautions to avoid getting injured. Keep your campsite clean. Take trash and food scraps to a trashcan. Do Not Feed the Animals. Not even once. It\u2019s bad for them, they can hurt you, and it\u2019s against the law. Don\u2019t touch, don\u2019t feed.  \u00a0      Jumping into water The beautiful varied landscape here at Chickasaw is very tempting to climb and jump from, especially into our lakes and streams. Understand that this can cause serious injuries. Be smart, check the area, only jump feet first or not at all!  \u00a0      Water Safety Our lakes do not have flat bottoms and have very irregular shorelines. When the water levels change, the underwater hazards also change. Always be alert of other boats on the lake, assume the other boats and personal watercraft can not see you, and steer clear. Drowning is the second leading cause of accidental death in children. Keep life jackets handy and make sure kids and non-swimmers are wearing them at all times.  \u00a0      Alcohol  Everyone knows that driving a vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs is dangerous, illegal and a good way to die or kill someone. The same goes for boating and swimming. Even if you aren\u2019t driving a boat, drinking alcohol impairs your judgment, your reflexes and your ability to save yourself or others.", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/chic/planyourvisit/safety.htm", "title": "Chickasaw National Recreation Area: Safety"}
