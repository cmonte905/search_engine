There are no paved roads between communities, and there\u2019s no land taxi service on Fire Island.  Driving Permits A very limited number of year-round residents, contractors, and other service providers are issued permits to drive on park lands for specific purposes.  If you\u2019re visiting in the summer, you should see few of these vehicles. National Park Service, Suffolk County Police Marine Bureau, and other official use vehicles must not be expected to provide transportation between locations. However, most park facilities are little more than a one-mile walk away from a small community. You may also call for a water taxi to transport you between designated sites. By Boat The use of personal watercraft\u2014PWCs or JetSkis\u2014is restricted within the boundaries of the park except in marked channels to some of the Fire Island communities.   If you\u2019re staying in the marina, you may use your inflatable or dinghy for access to other parts of the park or to neighboring public docks. For a fee, transient slips may be available at Watch Hill and Sailors Haven, and at some of the local communities and waterfront restaurants, but space is often limited. Off-shore mooring is allowed at this time without a permit. You may bring your dinghy or shallow-draft vessel onto the shoreline in the park, but the boat may not be tied to public docks or boardwalks.", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/fiis/planyourvisit/gettingaround.htm", "title": "Fire Island National Seashore: Getting Around"}
