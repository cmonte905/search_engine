Mather, 1920 Memorandum to the Secretary of the Interior In 1920 successful businessman and conservationist Stephen T. Mather stopped at Pipe Spring while touring the region by automobile. New to his job as the head of a new federal agency\u2014the National Park Service\u2014Mather believed that developing and promoting large scenic parks would capture America\u2019s support for a system of national parks.

At that time Mather\u2019s $500 contribution was the equivalent of six months\u2019 wages for a workingman\u2014or the cost of 25 steers.  \u00a0      \u00a0      << back   continue >>", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/pisp/learn/photosmultimedia/a-new-national-monument.htm", "title": "Pipe Spring National Monument: A New National Monument"}
