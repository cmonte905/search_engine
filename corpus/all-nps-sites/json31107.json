IPM is a decision-making process that coordinates knowledge of pest biology, the environment, and available technology to prevent unacceptable levels of pest damage, by cost-effective means, while posing the least possible risk to people, resources and the environment.  \u00a0     Red Imported Fire Ants.Inset photo: Fire Ant mound. www.forestryimages.orgAnts:USDA APHIS PPQ ArchivesMound: Scott Bauer; USDA  Structural pests that are common to Lyndon B.
