{"body": "Hike and Bike Trail         NPS  Click here for possible closure/alternate route information and map. Updated: 11/8/2013 Mission Portals connect San Antonio's four historic missions \u2013 Mission Concepci\u00f3n, Mission San Jose, Mission San Juan and Mission Espada \u2013 to the San Antonio River. These connections feature historic and artistic interpretations of the story of the missions and highlight their social and cultural importance to the area. This reinforces the importance of the river to the missions and encourages visitors to circulate between the Mission Riverwalk and the river. Project planners worked closely with the National Park Service to ensure that there would be a seamless transition between the Mission Riverwalk and the historic missions. Ask a Ranger or Docent at one of the missions for additional information. Transportation map Mission Riverwalk map  \u00a0     Calboxes on trail   Wending along side the San Antonio River, through old neighborhoods and farmlands, the Mission Hike and Bike Trail provides respite from the daily pressure and grind of city life. From Mission Concepci\u00f3n to Mission Espada, eight (8) miles of dedicated paved pathways are reserved for the hiker and biker. An easy walk or ride, it is suitable for even young members of the family. The trail is not a loop, so the round-trip path is actually 16 miles. However, walkers and bikers can start at any of the four missions and travel to the next mission, making the round trip only six (6) miles. Water is available at each mission. Food is available near Missions Concepci\u00f3n and San Jos\u00e9, but not near Missions San Juan and Espada, so plan accordingly.
