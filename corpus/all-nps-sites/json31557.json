{"body": "Adopt-A-Trail Program Overview          \u00a0     To Apply  Adopt-A-Trail is a volunteer program that allows the public to be active participants in preserving the beauty and recreational value of trails within New River Gorge National River, Gauley River National Recreation Area and Bluestone National Scenic River. Volunteers assist park staff in keeping trails safe and looking great so that everyone can enjoy them.   Community organizations, church groups, businesses, families and individuals are encouraged to get involved. Participants are welcome to select an available trail or park staff can help select a trail based on maintenance needs and volunteer preferences.  Hand tools and supplies are provided by the park or volunteers may use their own. Trails can be adopted year-round and adopters are encouraged to patrol and maintain their trail throughout the year.
