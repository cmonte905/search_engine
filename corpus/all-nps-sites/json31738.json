{"body": "Spiders and Insects       Poisonous Spiders Only two types of poisonous spiders may be found in the Bluestone National Scenic River area; the black widow and possibly the brown recluse, whose range may now be expanding into this area. While these spiders are rarely encountered on hikes or picnics, it is still important to be able to identify these spiders in case a bite is received.   \u00a0     Brown Recluse   Brown Recluse:  Description: \u2022 Has a violin shaped mark on its back  \u2022 A body length of 10 to 12 mm.  \u2022 6 eyes instead of the typical 8  Habitat:  Outdoors: \u2022 Beneath Rocks  \u2022 Under Debris  \u2022 In or around abandoned buildings  Indoors: \u2022 In attics and cellars.  \u2022 Storage rooms and crawlspaces.  Symptoms:  \u2022 Reaction varies from just a little red mark with no pain or other symptoms to more severe symptoms such as tissue damage and intense pain.  \u2022 Itching, chills, fever, nausea, vomiting, shock  \u2022 A small white blister usually forms at the bite site; the affected area may become red and tissue may be hard to the touch.  \u2022 A dry blue-gray or blue-white lesion may form.  \u00a0     Black Widow   Black Widow:  Description: \u2022 Black, shiny, globe-shaped spider.  \u2022 Red or orange hourglass shaped marking on the underside of its abdomen.  Habitat: \u2022 Cool, dark, moist areas.  \u2022 Widows are often found in buildings, wood piles, stone walls, and crawl spaces.  Symptoms: \u2022 Severity of the reaction can vary  \u2022 Venom acts on the nervous system, causing various degrees of pain  \u2022 Short stabbing pain  \u2022 Slight local swelling and two red spots (puncture points from the spider\u2019s fangs)  \u2022 Pain progresses from bite site to abdomen and back  \u2022 Nausea, profuse perspiration, difficulty breathing, tremors, increased blood pressure, fever  \u2022 Symptoms usually diminish after a day or so  Prevention: \u2022 Avoid sticking your hands in leaves, under rocks, or in places where you cannot see.  \u2022 Wear gloves when collecting firewood or moving rocks or yard debris.  \u2022 When camping, shake out clothing and shoes before getting dressed. If bitten: \u2022 Carefully attempt to catch the spider so it can be properly identified.  \u2022 Seek medical attention immediately.  \u00a0     Tick   Ticks    Ticks are blood-feeding parasites that are often found in tall grass and shrubs where they will wait to attach to a passing host. Physical contact is the only method of transportation for ticks. Ticks do not jump or fly, although they may drop from their perch and fall onto a host. Ticks will try to climb to the highest part of their host.  Habitat:  Ticks can be found in most wooded or tall grass land regions throughout the world. They are especially common in areas where deer are plentiful. Commons ticks here: \u2022 Dermacentor- commonly known as the Dog Tick This tick can carry Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever  \u2022 Ixodes - Know as the Deer Tick This tick can spread Lyme Disease Description: \u2022 Unfed males and females are reddish-brown and can be 3/16-inch long or smaller. They have hard shells, starting right behind the mouth. Prevention: \u2022 Wear protective clothing such as long-sleeved shirts, long trousers, boots or sturdy shoes. Ticks are easier to detect on light-colored clothing.  \u2022 Apply insect repellent containing 10 to 30 percent DEET primarily to clothes. Apply sparingly to exposed skin. Always follow label instructions on how to apply.  \u2022 Walk in the center of trails so weeds do not brush against you. Individuals who sit on the ground or disturb leaf litter on the forest floor may encounter ticks.  \u2022 Check yourself, children and other family members every two to three hours for ticks. Most ticks seldom attach quickly and rarely transmit disease organisms until they have been attached for four or more hours. If your pets spend time outdoors, check them for ticks.  \u2022 Take a shower immediately after coming in from being in the outdoors. Removal of tick: \u2022 If tick is on clothing use masking or duck tape to remove.  \u2022 The best way to remove a tick is to grasp it firmly with tweezers as close to the skin as possible and gently, but firmly, pull it straight out.  \u2022 Do not remove the tick with bare hands.  \u2022 To dispose of the tick, flush it down toilet.  \u2022 Wash the area around the bite thoroughly with soap and water, then apply antiseptic to the bite.  \u2022 If you have an unexplained illness with fever, contact a physician. Be sure to tell the physician if you have been outdoors in areas where ticks were present.

While most mosquitoes are harmless, some do carry diseases such as West Nile Virus.  West Nile Virus: West Nile Virus is a potentially serious illness. For more on the symptoms, prevention, and what to do if you believe you may have contracted the virus please visit the Center for Disease Control website via the link below.  http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/wnv_factsheet.htm  For further information: National Park Service Public Health Information Sheet Habitat: Mosquitoes are found in a greater number around bodies of water such as streams, rivers, ponds, and lakes. While their numbers will be greater in these areas, mosquitoes can be found throughout the area due to their ability to lay eggs wherever standing water may be found.  Prevention: The most efficient means to control mosquito populations and the spread of diseases carried by them is to reduce the amount of locations where they may lay their eggs. Mosquitoes require a water source to lay their eggs. Eliminating standing water will help to reduce populations. Mosquito habitat can often include: \u2022 Garbage Cans and Recycling Bins \u2022 Litter such as soda bottles and cans \u2022 Tires Protecting Yourself: \u2022 Use insect repellants with DEET, according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.  \u2022 Wear long sleeves and long pants when possible.  \u2022 When possible remain indoors at dawn, dusk, and in the early evening when mosquito\u2019s are most active.  \u2022 Ensure window screens or tent netting is in good condition.", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/blue/planyourvisit/spiders-and-insects.htm", "title": "Bluestone National Scenic River: Spiders and Insects"}
