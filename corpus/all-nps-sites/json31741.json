{"body": "Water Safety          Enjoy the Bluestone River safely, but do not underestimate its power. The water levels change daily and what may thought of as safe today, may not be as safe tomorrow. Enjoying the river safely: \u2022 Wear a personal flotation device (PFD or lifejacket) anytime you are boating, swimming, or fishing. Most drownings involve people who didn\u2019t plan on being in the water. Life jackets save lives.   \u2022 Do not leave children unattended. They often don\u2019t recognize danger. Young children can drown in relatively shallow water.  \u2022 Always wear sturdy shoes. There are sharp objects in the water that will cut bare feet.  \u2022 Approximately half of all boating and swimming deaths involve alcohol. Alcohol and river activities do not mix.  \u2022 Wear sunscreen, sunglasses, and a hat even on cloudy days.  \u2022 Avoid dehydration by drinking plenty of water.  \u2022 In the event of severe weather, such as strong winds and lightning, get away from the river as soon as possible and seek shelter.  \u2022 Do not swim or boat alone.  \u2022 Exposure to cool air and cold water can lead to hypothermia even when temperatures are above freezing.  \u2022 Be safe on shore. Accidents often happen to anglers, waders, and \u201crock-hoppers.\u201d Boating: \u2022 Know your skill level. Boating requires special skills and abilities. Be cautious and use the section of the river that best matches your skill.  \u2022 Know the conditions. The river changes dramatically with different water levels. What is safe at one level can be hazardous at another. Be alert for changes in the weather.  \u2022 Plan your trip. Know your put-in and take-out points before you begin. Tell someone your plans.  \u2022 Load your boat properly. Secure equipment to prevent shifting. Carry a first aid kit.  \u2022 If you are boating always scout ahead because rapids and unmarked hazards can occur at any time.  \u2022 Avoid overhanging tree limbs and downed trees, they can overturn and trap boats.  \u2022 Learn how to read the river. Follow the smooth water shaped \u201cV\u201d that points down stream. Water ripples indicate that rocks are lying close to the surface.  \u2022 If you capsize, stay upstream of your boat and swim toward shore. Currents push against your boat that can trap you and hold you underwater. If you capsize in rapids, stay on your back with your feet pointed downstream while your life jacket keeps you afloat, until you have an opportunity to swim toward shore.", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/blue/planyourvisit/water-safety.htm", "title": "Bluestone National Scenic River: Water Safety"}
