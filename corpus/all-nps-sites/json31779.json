{"body": "Snakes          While there are many different types of snakes found at Gauley River National Recreation Area, only two types are poisonous; the Northern Copperhead and the Timber Rattlesnake. Although these snakes are not normally aggressive, they can bite if surprised or threatened. Copperheads and rattlesnakes are an essential part of the natural ecosystem and an important component in the natural food chain. Please remember that snakes are protected at Gauley River National Recreation Area; it is illegal to harm them. Common Traits The copperhead and the rattlesnake share three characteristics that can quickly distinguish them from other non-venomous snakes. 1. Broad, flattened, arrow shaped heads with narrow necks, while the heads of non venomous snakes are long and slender. 2. The venomous snakes have elliptical shaped eyes similar to a cat's eye, while non venomous snakes eyes are round. 3. Sensory pits located near the nostrils are also unique to venomous snakes. Northern Copperhead Description: \u2022 Bright copper colored head \u2022 Reddish brown with a series of darker hourglass or saddlebag shaped markings down backs. \u2022 Pinkish belly \u2022 2 to 3 feet in length Habitat: \u2022 Found in wooded, rocky, mountainous regions. Characteristics: \u2022 Copperheads will usually freeze and remain motionless when in the presence of danger. \u2022 When agitated a copperhead may vibrate its tail rapidly in an attempt to warn off danger.  \u00a0      Timber Rattlesnake: Description: \u2022 A rattle at the end of its tail. \u2022 Bright yellow to dull gray in color. \u2022 Brown or black chevron shaped markings along its back. \u2022 Can grow up to 6 ft in length. Habitat: \u2022 Found in wooded, rocky, mountainous regions. Characteristics: \u2022 Active from late April to mid October. \u2022 Will seldom bite unless disturbed. How to avoid being bitten: \u2022 Stick to designated walking and biking trails. \u2022 Do not place your hands or feet where you can't see. \u2022 Keep all pets on a leash. \u2022 If you see a snake, do not provoke it or try to pick it up, just avoid it. First Aid for a Snake Bite: \u2022 Get away from the snake. Rattlesnakes and copperheads can strike at a distance equal to about half their body length and can bite more than once. Do not attempt to kill or capture the snake. \u2022 Stay calm; don't panic. \u2022 Look for signs of envenomation: severe burning pain at the site of the bite, swelling beginning within about five minutes of getting bit and progressing up the limb, discoloration and blood-filled blisters developing in 6 to 48 hours. In at least 25% of bites, no venom is injected. \u2022 If there are immediate symptoms, get help immediately. \u2022 Send someone for help; Call 911 \u2022 Try to keep the affected limb lowered below the victims heart \u2022 Keep the victim as quiet and calm as possible; activity can increase venom absorption. \u2022 Seek medical help even if there is no immediate reaction. All bites can cause infection and should be treated by a physician.", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/gari/planyourvisit/snakes.htm", "title": "Gauley River National Recreation Area: Snakes"}
