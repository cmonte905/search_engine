{"body": "Water Safety         \u00a9John L. Dengler  Enjoy the Gauley River safely, but do not underestimate its power. The Gauley River is a high volume river with swift currents, deep holes, and a rocky bottom. The water levels change daily and what may thought of as safe today, may not be as safe tomorrow. Your safety while in, on, or around the Gauley River is our concern. We suggest these water safety reminders during your visit: All Water Activities: \u2022 Everyone should wear a personal flotation device (PFD or lifejacket) anytime you are near or in the Gauley River. Life jackets save lives. \u2022 Do not leave children unattended. They often don't recognize danger. Young children can drown in relatively shallow water. \u2022 Always wear sturdy shoes. There are sharp objects in the water that will cut bare feet. \u2022 Approximately half of all boating and swimming deaths involve alcohol. Alcohol and river activities do not mix. \u2022 Wear sunscreen, sunglasses, and a hat even on cloudy days. \u2022 Avoid dehydration by drinking plenty of water. \u2022 In the event of severe weather, such as strong winds and lightning, get away from the river as soon as possible and seek shelter. \u2022 There are drop-offs, strong currents, and hydraulics (undertows) all along the Gauley River. \u2022 Do not swim or boat alone. Travel together, there is safety in numbers. \u2022 Exposure to cool air and cold water can lead to hypothermia even when temperatures are above freezing. \u2022 \u2022 Be safe on shore. Accidents often happen to anglers, waders, and \"rock-hoppers.\" Boating: \u2022 Know your skill level. Whitewater boating requires special skills and abilities. Be cautious and use the section of the river that best matches your skill. \u2022 Know the conditions. The river changes dramatically with different water levels. What is safe at one level can be hazardous at another. Be alert for changes in the weather. \u2022 Plan your trip. Know your put-in and take-out points before you begin. Tell someone your plans. \u2022 Load your boat properly. Secure equipment to prevent shifting. Carry a first aid kit. \u2022 If you are boating always scout ahead because rapids and unmarked hazards can occur at any time. \u2022 Avoid overhanging tree limbs and downed trees, they can overturn and trap boats. \u2022 Learn how to read the river. Follow the smooth water shaped \"V\" that points down stream. Water ripples indicate that rocks are lying close to the surface. \u2022 If you capsize, stay upstream of your boat and swim toward shore. Currents push against your boat that can trap you and hold you underwater. If you capsize in rapids, stay on your back with your feet pointed downstream while your life jacket keeps you afloat, until you have an opportunity to swim toward shore. River Etiquette: \u2022 What you pack in, pack out. Help keep the Gauley River clean. Dispose of trash properly. \u2022 Be health conscious. Human waste should not be left within 100 feet of the river or other water, and should be buried at least six inches deep. \u2022 Respect the rights of private property owners.", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/gari/planyourvisit/water-safety.htm", "title": "Gauley River National Recreation Area: Water Safety"}
