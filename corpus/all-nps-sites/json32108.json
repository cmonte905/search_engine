To best understand the role of the 5 themes of geography as these apply globally, this unit will apply these very themes locally to our historical connection of agriculture as well as our sense of place here in Woodstock. Agricultural values and related culture came to shape the history and land of New England. Students will learn how our agricultural beginnings here in Woodstock, through upclose studies of the MacKenzie(now a part of the national park), King, and Billings Farms came to shape our landscape and our lives. Students will discover how on these very lands through a series of historical events, changes in technology, and understanding of sustainable land use, many of Vermont's hillside have transformed from agricultural farm to forest. Background \u00a0  *This unit is designed with opportunities for interdisciplinary connections. For example, in English classes students could assess the value of historical diaries in understanding our agricultural heritage, develop writing skills using sensory language, and a book talk featuring the young adolescent book, \u201cAs Long as There are Mountains\u201d by Natalie Kinsey-Warnock. In science classes, students might study soil, plant genetics, see varieties and create a school garden. Math would play a role in scaling factor as well as units of measurement, i.e. rods, acres, etc. Materials \u00b7GPS \u00b7Digital Cameras \u00b7Historical Photographs, if possible Additional Resources Books: Russell, Howard S., \u201cA Long, Deep Furrow: Three Centuries of Farming in New England.\u201d Hanover, N.H.: University Press of New England, 1982. \u00a0Additional Teacher Resources include: Jan Albers, \u201cHands on the Land: A History of the Vermont Landscape\u201d Tom Wessels, \u201cReading the Forested Landscape: A Natural History of New England\u201d Christopher Klyza and Stephen Trombulak, \u201cThe Story of Vermont: A Natural and Cultural History\u201d \u00a0Student Text: \u201cPrentice Hall World Studies Foundations of Geography.\u201d Pearson/Prentice Hall: Boston, 2008. \u00a0Reports: \u201cArchaeological Overview and Assessment of the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park, Woodstock, Windsor County, Vermont\u201d\u00a0 University of Vermont, Report No. 446\u00a0 January, 2007 \u201cNational Register of Historic Places- The King Farm\u201d United States Department of the Interior \u201cCultural Landscape Report, Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park 2009 Websites: \u201cWithin These Walls\u201d an interactive view of a 19th century home in Ipswich, Ma. http://americanhistory.si.edu/house/home.asp Map Analysis, includes a 1677 map of New England http://www.1704.deerfieldhistory.museum/maps/foster.htm/ Historic Maps http://historymaters.gmu.edu/mse/maps Historical Sites and links at \u201cAmerican Memory\u201d http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/gmdhtml/chsvhome.html Sturbridge Village: Farm Family Understanding Daily Life on a Farm using Primary Resources http://www.osv.org/school/lesson_plans/ShowLessons.php?LessonID=34 Landscape Change Project, Univerisity of Vermont http://www.uvm.edu/landscape/ National Geographic \u201cXpeditions\u201d website contains a variety of useful and related lesson plans           Lesson Plans  Ecology Unit   Marine Ecology - Water Testing   History of Floyd Bennett Field    Distance Learning  The Human Story   \u201cThey Fought Like Tigers\u201d African American Soldiers and American Indian Soldiers   Trail of Tears Teacher's Workbook     Field Trips  Winter Ecology Field Trip (Grades 1-2)   Fire Ecology Field Trip   Winter Ecology Field Trip (grades 6-12)    Topics  Hoofin' It! - The Bean Counters: Mark-Recapture   Day 2 of Biodiversity Bee Week: Flower Dissection / Insect Pollination   \"Animal Olympics\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Wildlife:\u00a0  4-6th Grade", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/mabi/learn/education/classrooms/mount-tom-from-farm-to-forest.htm", "title": "Marsh - Billings - Rockefeller National Historical Park: Mount Tom From Farm to Forest"}
