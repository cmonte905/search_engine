Support from the public is essential to maintain them. This support can come in many forms: financial, gifts of material goods, volunteer efforts, or political support.  \u00a0    Volunteers plant willows and alders along the restored Doan Creek. This creek was a free-flowing stream during the Whitmans' time, but over the years the water had been diverted to other uses. Today water again flows through Doan Creek much as it did during the time of the Whitmans. NPS photo   \u00a0     A donation box sits on the Visitor Center information desk.
