{"body": "Trees and Shrubs        Trees, such as these London sycamores that line the park's parking area, provide much appreciated shade during the hot, dry summer months. NPS   \u00a0   Whitman Mission National Historic Site is located in what was once an extensive grassland. Except for in the mountains, trees would have been relatively few and found mostly next to streams and rivers. When the Whitmans came they wanted trees. Dr. Whitman wrote to friends back east asking for locust, chestnut, and walnut seeds. Narcissa obtained sprouts of apple and peach trees from Fort Vancouver. Today the trees the Whitmans planted are long gone. But people still love trees. Landscapers planted many trees and shrubs on the park grounds to add beauty and provide shade. An apple orchard was created to represent the one planted by Dr. Whitman. Below is a list of trees and shrubs found in the park along with some of the places where they can be seen.  \u00a0   Maple Family  Silver Maple (Acer saccharinum) - behind Visitor Center Red Maple (Acer rubrum) - along path from Visitor Center to Great Grave and in picnic area Norwegian Maple (Acer platanoides) - along path from Visitor Center to Great Grave and in picnic area   \u00a0   Rose Family  Wild Rose (Rosa eglanteria) - along re-constructed Oregon Trail ruts Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.) - along path from Visitor Center to mission grounds Crab Apple (Malus spp.) - east entrance of Visitor Center and in parking oval Domestic Apple (Malus domestica) - orchard near First House   \u00a0   Willow Family  Willow (Salix spp.) - between First House and Grist Mill Silver Poplar (Populus alba) - in Tipi Grove Eastern Cottonwood (Populus deltoides) - near First House and pond   \u00a0   Sycamore Family  American Sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) - near Mill Pond London Sycamore (Platanus x acerifolia) - parking lot   \u00a0   Pea Family  Black Locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) - mission grounds, base of hill, and parking oval   \u00a0   Elm Family  Siberian Elm (Ulmus pumila) - Pioneer Cemetery and south side of hill Elm (Ulmus spp.) - base of hill near Alice Clarissa's marker   \u00a0   Hydrangea Family  Mock Orange (Philadelphus lewisii) - junction of re-constructed Oregon Trail ruts and path to mission grounds   \u00a0   Olive Family  Black Ash (Fraxinus nigra) - east entrance of Visitor Center Common Lilac (Syringa vulgaris) -Pioneer Cemetery   \u00a0   Dogwood Family  Dogwood (Cornus spp.) - parking oval   \u00a0   Elderberry Family  Blue Elderberry (Sambucus cerulea) - picnic area, base of hill, and along entrance road to park   \u00a0   Cashew Family  Staghorn Sumac (Rhus typhina) - picnic area Sumac (Rhus spp.) - near Mill Pond   \u00a0   Walnut Family  English Walnut (Juglans regia) - near First House   \u00a0   Ailanthus Family  Tree-of-Heaven (Ailanthus altissima) - Great Grave and Tipi Grove   \u00a0   Conifers  Blue Spruce (Picea pungens) - parking oval", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/whmi/learn/nature/treesandshrubs.htm", "title": "Whitman Mission National Historic Site: Trees and Shrubs"}
