{"body": "Non-native species        \u201cThe two great destroyers of biodiversity are, first habitat destruction and, second, invasion by exotic species.\u201d \u2013E.O. Wilson   The spread of invasive species is recognized as a major factor contributing to ecosystem change and instability leading to biodiversity reduction. Preventing non-native invasives from becoming established has a much better rate of success than eliminating the species once it is established. At the Apostle Islands, both aquatic and terrestrial species continually threaten the park. From microscopic organisms to large trees, the potential is always there for non-native species to invade and overtake the fragile ecosystems that make the lakeshore a popular destination for hikers, boaters, and sightseers alike.   Skip ahead on this page:     Non-native invasive species  What can be done?  Spreading non-native species  Apostle Islands non-native species reports       \u00a0    Park Ranger is attacked by Japanese Knotweed Damon Panek   \u00a0   Non-native invasive species Invasive species are non-native species which cause harm to the economy, environment, or human health. Their common characteristics are: \u2022 Cause more harm than good to the invaded ecosystem \u2022 High growth/reproduction rate \u2022 Free from established predators, competitors parasites or diseases in the invaded ecosystem \u2022 Easily dispersed/moved from place to place  Many of these species can be transported via boats such as on hulls and in bilges, on our clothing or gear that has come in contact with them, and even our firewood. For example, the zebra mussel can be transported from water body to water body through just a few drops of water. Spotted knapweed, a plant which has the potential to invade every beach on the Apostle Islands, can be transported and established through seeds carried in the soles of a shoe. The gypsy moth can be easily transported on firewood.   \u00a0   What can be done? \u201cThis is one environmental problem that we can do something about. I have seen the tremendous difference that even a few individuals can make in the battle to regain the land for native species.\u201d -E. Czarapata  The best way to solve a problem is to prevent it from happening. Actions all visitors can take are preventative measures to keep non-native invasive species out of The Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. Whether kayaking, sailing, hiking, camping, fishing, or enjoying a picnic, attention can be given to keeping invasives out. \u2022 Burn only dead and down firewood from the islands \u2022 Clean, drain, and dry watercraft of all sizes \u2022 Dispose of all fishing bait properly \u2022 Clean all camping, boating, hiking, and other equipment after use \u2022 Get involved in conservation efforts \u2022 Educate yourself and others about invasive species   \u00a0    Kayaker cleaning his boat of invasives Neil Howk   \u00a0   Spreading non-native invasive species \u201cGive a weed and inch and it will take a yard\u201d \u2013Anonymous  The rapid natural spread of a non-native invasive species is usually due its general lack of predators, competitors, parasites, and disease in the invaded ecosystem. Essentially, there are inadequate factors to bar the movement and establishment of an invasive species in an ecosystem which it is not native to. The interdependent balance which preserves an ecosystem\u2019s biodiversity is disrupted by the addition of an invasive non-native plant, animal, insect, or pathogen.  Human actions are the most pivotal factors in the spreading of non-native invasive species. Check this list of the most common ways humans have spread invasives to see how many you pay attention to during your park visits. \u2022 Gypsy Moth or Emerald Ash borer in firewood \u2022 Zebra mussels or Eurasian Water Milfoil on boat hulls/bilges/boat trailers \u2022 Spotted Knapweed seeds on clothing or footwear \u2022 Camping equipment carrying soil infected with the sudden oak death pathogen \u2022 Pet\u2019s fur carrying Purple Loosestrife seeds \u2022 Bait buckets being dumped with minnows infected with VHS pathogen \u2022 Transplanting non-native plants from other areas \u2022 Tire treads containing buckthorn berries \u2022 Non-native landscaping close to native ecosystems \u2022 Ship ballasts bringing the next aquatic invasive from oversees  Strive to be invasive free\u2026 Your actions make a difference   \u00a0   Apostle Islands National Lakeshore non-native species reports", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/apis/learn/nature/non-native-species.htm", "title": "Apostle Islands National Lakeshore: Non-native species"}
