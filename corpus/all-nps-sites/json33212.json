{"body": "Carbon River Project       The following film includes interviews with Eric Walkinshaw, Project Manager and Civil Engineer for Mount Rainier National Park, and Kirt Hanson, Project Engineer and Geologist with Cardno Entrix, discussing the work that has been going on in the Carbon area to protect the road and facilities from future damage through the installation of flood protection structures such as engineered log jams. The historic Carbon River Road was heavily damaged during a November 2006 storm event that resulted in heavy flooding and closed the road to vehicle use since then. Due to aggradation, rocks and gravel have raised the bed of the Carbon River up as much as 31 feet since the Carbon River Road was constructed next to the river in the 1920s. Several sections of the historic road are now lower than the adjacent river and increasingly vulnerable to flood damage.   \u00a0          Carbon River Project   Loading the player...    Transcript Carbon River Project TRANSCRIPTInterview with Eric Walkinshaw, Project Manager & Civil Engineer, Mount Rainier National Park; and Kirt Hanson, Project Engineer & Geologist, Cardno EntrixWalkinshaw: My name is Eric Walkinshaw. I\u2019m the Project Manager Civil Engineer here at Mount Rainier National Park and we\u2019re at the Carbon River Entrance Area; and we\u2019re involved in a project of installing about five log-constructed flood protection structures. So it protects the entrance station to the park and some other facilities here in the park. We hired the consultant to come in and they did the design work for us for these structures last October of 2010 and now we actually have a contractor on board: Mike McClung & Co., Construction Company (Mike McClung Construction, Inc., Buckley, WA), and they\u2019re constructing these structures for us; and Kirt\u2019s here to kind of oversee that part of the project to make some adjustments if they\u2019re needed on the structures. Hanson: Yeah, I\u2019m Kirt Hanson, Engineer and Geologist with Cardno Entrix. I\u2019m excited to be part of what I think is a historic project. Engineered log jams have been around in ecologic and bank protection, flood protection systems for going on probably close to twenty years- more likely fifteen- and this is the first project where an engineered log jam has been installed inside of a National Park.Walkinshaw: We, like I said, we\u2019re constructing a total of about five of these structures, one of which is called an engineered log jam, which is a more beefier structure, and that\u2019s on the leading edge just up upstream, about a hundred yards from us. It\u2019s basically to calm the water, to have some habitat, but also in calming the water it drops out material that the river is carrying, mostly rock and silt. So by doing that it kind of builds up that area so when the river floods again it forces it over more to the center of the channel and away from our banks. So that\u2019s the intent of that, but we had the advantage in this area of having a natural log jam, which is kind of what you see back behind us; there is another one further down where the contractor is currently working. So Entrix designed these linear structures as kind of fences on either side of those to kind of contain that. What they didn\u2019t want to have happen- what we don\u2019t want to have happen, is for those natural log jams to raise up and float and leave. Cause they\u2019re in a good location that\u2019s protecting our facilities but they needed the added help of putting in these structures to kind of encapsulate it so it doesn\u2019t float away-Hanson: -to reinforce the existing log jams. Hanson: The first thing the contractor is taking care of is ground water, and McClung has done an absolute fantastic job of maintaining their de-watering systems. That involves an initial excavation to a depth below the bottom of the structure, typically these initial excavations extend 17-18 feet below the ground surface to create a sump. From that point, the ground water is pumped into a sedimentation system where fine sediments are dropped out before being returned to the river. The general, on this particular project, the general depth to the bottom of our excavation is about fifteen feet. That\u2019s where these vertical piles that you can see right behind me, that\u2019s the elevation that those are installed to: fifteen feet below the ground\u2019s surface. This pile, here, is actually, it\u2019s probably about five and a half feet tall from where I\u2019m standing- this is actually over a twenty-five foot pile. So there\u2019s about twenty feet of log buried beneath my feet right here. So following the installation of the vertical piles, there\u2019s an angled log that extends- that log is about thirty-five feet long, extending back into the earth, also excavated to a depth of about fifteen feet below existing pre-construction ground surface. Following the installation of those, other horizontal members are added, racking material out front to help control scour, and also create fish habitat, is installed, and final site grading completed. This is an innovative design, designed to catch additional wooden debris coming down the channel, creating additional habitat, and providing additional stability to the existing park structure and park entrance. Walkinshaw: Basically all of our rivers are a lot like this. We\u2019re having problems in other areas as far as getting a lot of deposition, getting the river bed higher than our facilities, dealing with levees, dealing with- we\u2019re going to be installing, especially on- hopefully on the the success of these, which I\u2019m really confident that these are going- I mean they are pretty beefy structures, I think they\u2019re going to do the trick- and so we\u2019re going to use them a lot. This is just really the first, as Kirt mentioned, this is really the first location that we\u2019ve done it in earnest, these many structures. So we\u2019re really going to be watching this and seeing how it performs and I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to use it in a lot of other locations.\u00a0  Close Transcript     Visit JWPlayer docs for keyboard shortcuts  Duration:5 minutes, 33 seconds  Discover what it takes to install flood protection structures such as engineered log jams.
