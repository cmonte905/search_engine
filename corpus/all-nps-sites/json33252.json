NPS Photo  Fishing Mount Rainier National Park isn\u2019t known for its fishing, so don\u2019t be disappointed if you fail to catch fish, or if the fish are small! Only experienced anglers do well and then only during limited times of the season. Rivers and streams are open from late-May or early-June through late-October, and most lakes are ice-free July through October. Several species of fish listed under the Endangered Species Act are present in park streams. Native resident trout are also found in park streams. Therefore, we encourage you to use barbless hooks and artificial lures and to release uninjured fish. No fishing license is required in the park. However, if you plan to overnight in the backcountry, you will need a wilderness permit. Native vs. Non-native fish Park lakes didn\u2019t support a fish population prior to stocking in the early 1900s. The NPS stopped stocking in 1973 because of the negative effect non-native fish had on natural aquatic ecosystems including effects on local amphibian populations. However, at least 27 lakes still contain reproducing populations of introduced fish, including eastern brook trout, rainbow, and cutthroat stocks. Salmon such as coho and chinook were historically present in park waters. However, fish passage is now blocked by dams on the Cowlitz, Nisqually, Puyallup, and White Rivers. Fish are trucked around some of these dams. The Carbon River is the only major drainage in the park without constructed dams blocking fish passage. Learn about fish species still found in the park.  Fishing Regulations Park fishing regulations are generally in accordance with those of the surrounding area waters of the State of Washington. Park-specific regulations and closures are included in the information below. Fishing for bull trout and Chinook Salmon, both federally-listed threatened species, is prohibited in the park.
