Slocum Drive will also be closed one day (to be determined) during the week of\u00a0August 22\u00a0for final application of the chip-seal surface. Scheduled closures of the road will apply to all users--vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians.\u00a0 Cyclists should note that the chip-seal surface will be unsuitable for bicycling for up to two months after the resurfacing is completed.\u00a0The chip-seal process involves the laying of loose gravel on a base of tar. The gravel is rolled into place during installation, but it requires several weeks of active traffic to clear the road of loose gravel.\u00a0In the meantime, cyclists should NOT use Slocum Drive.\u00a0 Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania County Battlefields National Military Park in Northern Virginia was once the bloodiest landscape in North America. Two major Civil War armies clashed in and around Fredericksburg in four pivotal battles within an 18-month span, resulting in 100,000 casualties. The park is the second largest military park in the world and covers four major battlefields and five historic structures. Our dedicated staff works year round to ensure that this important historic and cultural resource is preserved, protected, and interpreted for hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/frsp/learn/news/slocum-drive.htm", "title": "Fredericksburg & Spotsylvania National Military Park: Slocum Drive Chip Seal"}
