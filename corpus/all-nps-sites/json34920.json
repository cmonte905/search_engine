Transcript Hi folks, I\u2019m Karen Henker at Canyonlands National Park.One of the more interesting features at Canyonlands is something easily overlooked: potholes. Now I\u2019m not talking about the kind that could send you over the handle bars of your bike, or knock your car out of alignment. I\u2019m talking about these: desert potholes, that some people call ephemeral pools. They can be found all over the park, wherever the rock surface is more or less level.When they\u2019re dry, they\u2019re pretty unremarkable. You might see some dirt, a few seedlings, and not much else. But when a good rain comes to fill this up with water, you\u2019ll find a tiny ecosystem filled with a surprising collection of animals. Let\u2019s take a look. Most people don\u2019t think of seafood when they visit Canyonlands, but potholes can actually contain several types of shrimp, including clam, fairy and tadpole shrimp. Tadpole shrimp look like miniature horseshoe crabs and are actually living fossils. Some species of tadpole shrimp haven\u2019t changed in appearance for over 200 million years\u2026making them the oldest living animal we know about. Other pothole dwellers include snails, mites, rotifers, worms and tardigrades. Tardigades - also called \u201cwater bears\u201d or \u201cmoss piglets\u201d \u2013 are cute, feisty little creatures. They\u2019re about a half a millimeter long, so you really need a microscope to see them. Tardigrades live all over the world\u2026any place there is water: on moss, in lakes or ponds, and in desert potholes.Now when the pothole is nice and full, tardigrades swim around happy as can be. When the sun comes out and the water starts to evaporate, tardigrades get ready for an amazing change. They secrete wax out of the armor plating across their backs and start to lose moisture. They can actually lose 99% of their body\u2019s moisture, and slow their metabolism down to one-tenth of 1% of normal, entering an extreme hibernation-like state. When they are in this state, surrounded by a little waxy cyst called a \u201cton,\u201d tardigrades can survive incredible climate change. Scientists have studied them in labs. They\u2019ve heated them to 300 degrees Fahrenheit, and frozen them to negative 300 degrees Fahrenheit\u2026and nothing happens. I\u2019ve heard they can even survive 1,000 times the radiation that would kill a human being\u2026but nothing happens. They don\u2019t experience tissue damage when they\u2019re in that ton. All they\u2019re doing is waiting\u2026for the rain. It might take one storm, or two or three, to fill the pothole back up. But once it\u2019s full, the tardigrades respond pretty quickly. In about four hours, they\u2019re swimming around again, happy as can be.Not all pothole critters are as resilient. In fact, most survive just long enough to reproduce and lay their eggs before the pothole dries up. As you might imagine, long-term changes in temperature and precipitation can dramatically affect potholes. Scientists think they might give us clues about the biological impacts of climate change, so they\u2019ve been monitoring them here at Canyonlands for some time.Potholes are also sensitive to human impacts. So when you visit the park, don\u2019t stick your finger in the wet pothole or your foot in the dry one. Just walk around them, and when you do, think a moment about the life that\u2019s waiting there at the bottom for the next big rain.I\u2019m Karen Henker. Thanks for joining me on Inside Canyonlands.
