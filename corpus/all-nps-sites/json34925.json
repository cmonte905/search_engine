Transcript Hi, folks.\u00a0 I\u2019m Karen Henker at Canyonlands National Park.Many visitors to Canyonlands are surprised when they\u2019re told to be careful where they walk, for the dirt here is actually alive.Biological soil crust is a common surface covering here in Canyonlands and the surrounding area, and without it there would be almost no life in this desert.\u00a0 The knobby black crust you see here is really a whole community of microscopic organisms, including moss, algae, fungi, and lichens.\u00a0 The real star of the show, however, is a tiny organism called cyanobacteria.Cyanobacteria - or blue-green algae - are one of the oldest known life forms on earth.\u00a0 Under a microscope, they look like tiny little worms, and when they get wet they move through the soil, leaving behind long, sticky fibers.\u00a0 Sand grains and soil particles stick to these fibers, creating a delicate structure filled with tiny holes.\u00a0 Imagine this sponge-like sand structure as a miniature apartment building, where moss, algae, fungi and lichens move in as tenants.\u00a0 It takes decades \u2013 even a century \u2013 for the full community to form.Where soil crust develops, the whole neighborhood benefits.\u00a0 A solid coating of crust resists erosion by wind and water, and provides a stable place for plants to grow.\u00a0 After a rainfall, soil crust soaks up water like a sponge, giving local plants a nice long drink.\u00a0 Also, the cyanobacteria help convert nitrogen in the air into a form plants can use, which is very important in this resource-poor desert habitat.Unfortunately, it takes only one careless, Godzilla-like step to crush the community and destroy the whole thing.\u00a0 Soil crust takes many years to re-form after damage, if ever, yet avoiding it is simple.\u00a0 When hiking, walk on established trails, bare rock, or sandy washes where crust doesn\u2019t grow.\u00a0 Vehicles and bikes should stay on designated roads, respect road closures, and only pass other vehicles where they won\u2019t damage roadside vegetation.In many national parks you are asked to \u201cTake only pictures and leave only footprints.\u201d\u00a0 At Canyonlands, we ask you to be even more careful with your feet, and \u201cDon\u2019t Bust the Crust!\u201d\u00a0 Your cooperation will ensure that the park remains healthy, beautiful, and wild for generations to come.I\u2019m Karen Henker.\u00a0 Thanks for joining me on Inside Canyonlands.
