NPS  An Unlikely Giant in Capitol Reef National Park The discovery of giant stromatolite fossils in the Navajo Sandstone is part of a growing body of research challenging some long-held assumptions about the Paleo-environment of the Navajo erg. The Navajo Sandstone, a prominent and well-exposed rock unit in the Colorado Plateau, was once an enormous, arid sea of blowing sands (called an erg) often compared to the present Sahara Desert. This early Jurassic dune field covered close to half a million square kilometers and reached a thickness in excess of 700 meters making it one of the largest dune fields in the history of Earth. Although the Navajo erg is generally thought to have been an expansive and lonely desert, new fossils found in Capitol Reef National Park suggest otherwise. During an extended backpacking trip, the senior author stumbled across what he described looked \u201calmost like a giant haystack\u201d or \u201ca giant limestone onion slowly being peeled.\u201d This turned out to be the serendipitous discovery of the first known stromatolite in the Navajo Sandstone and possibly the first stromatolite within an erg setting. Eisenberg, an independent geology consultant, spent the next several years researching the occurrence and the discovery was reported in the February, 2003 issue of Geology. Note: What is a stromatolite? A stromatolite is produced by cyanobacteria. The distinctive layers are produced as calcium carbonate is precipitated over the growing mat of bacterial filaments. Photosynthesis in the bacteria depletes carbon dioxide in the surrounding water and makes it less acidic thus initiating the precipitation of the calcium carbonate. The minerals, along with grains of sediment precipitating from the water become trapped within the sticky layer of mucilage that surrounds the bacterial colonies. As the colony continues to grow upwards through the sediment a new layer is formed. As this process occurs over and over again, the layers of sediment are created.  \u00a0     The Capitol Reef Stromatolites stand out like \u201chaystacks\u201d from the surrounding rock because they are composed of limestone, which is more resistant to weathering in a desert environment than the surrounding sandstone. NPS  Stromatolites are bizarre fossils whose biological origins were debated until only a few decades ago. Today, scientists generally agree that stromatolites are layered colonial structures predominately formed by cyanobacteria. Stromatolites are the oldest fossils on earth, dating back to more than three billion years ago. They were the dominant life form on earth for over 2 billion years and are thought to be primarily responsible for the oxygenation of the atmosphere. Living and fossil stromatolites are usually no more than half a meter tall and are found in marine environments. In contrast, the Capitol Reef Stromatolites are up to five meters in height and appear in thin carbonate beds associated with interdune deposits. Please Note: The fossil stromatolites at Capitol Reef are not easily accessible and somewhat hard to find. If you\u2019re up for a long day-hike or an overnighter, one of the best locations to see the stromatolites is located along Cottonwood wash in the central-eastern section of the Park. Always check in with the park staff before going on any overnight or extended trips into the back country of the park. As always, removal or vandalism of any fossil is strictly prohibited. The most important implication of the fossils is the suggestion of large bodies of standing water necessary to sustain the towering stromatolites. \u201cWe need to reevaluate the whole Paleo-environment,\u201d David Loope of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln says. \u201cUntil we had the stromatolites the general picture was hyper-arid,\u201d he says. Dr. Marjorie Chan of the University of Utah agrees, saying that despite the dry and dusty impression of the Navajo erg, \u201cit in fact had water and lakes.\u201d  \u00a0     The best modern analogues to fossil stromatolites can be found in Shark Bay, Australia. NPS  This is a dramatically different picture of the Navajo than previously thought. The Navajo erg \u201cmay not be analogous to the present Sahara\u201d in that it had the \u201cpotential for heavy rain and long lived episodes of water,\u201d Loope says. Long lived episodes of water would also translate into extended periods of erg stabilization. Researchers have long \u201csuspected that the Navajo must have stabilized at some point,\u201d although this is the first direct evidence of such stabilization. Modern ergs are known to periodically stabilize, a recent example being the \u201cgreening period\u201d of the Sahara between four to ten thousand years ago. Using growth rates for modern stromatolites, it can be determined that the fossil stromatolites grew over a period of a few thousand to over ten thousand years, putting them \u201cright in the ballpark, \u2026in the thousands of years range,\u201d with the duration of the Sahara stabilization. If the Navajo erg stabilized for thousands of years, it would mark a major stratigraphic boundary within the Navajo Sandstone. Right now, \u201cthe Navajo is a big pile of sand and it\u2019s hard to know where you are stratigraphically,\u201d \u201cThe next step is the \u201ccorrelation of these scattered outcrops\u201d to help \u201cunravel the internal geometry and history of the Navajo erg.\u201d Further correlation of interdune carbonate deposits could also suggest a regional climatic event, helping to improve climatic models of the Early Jurassic.  \u00a0     Similar organisms, identical in form and structure, can be found in the outlet channel of Octopus Springs in Yellowstone National Park. Living stromatolites are rare today and are usually only found in hyper-saline waters. NPS  \"There is variability that we never realized that was there,\" Chan says. \"Just when you think you know it all, we discover there's a lot we didn't know.\" The stromatolites in Capitol Reef National Park have renewed interest in the Navajo Sandstone and provide insight into the biology and environmental history of the Navajo erg, all from a walk in the Park.
