During the fall visitors should have a light jacket available as temperatures can drop suddenly. Winter temperatures can be unpredictable, ranging from mild to extremely cold.  Insects Visitors should be prepared by wearing appropriate clothing and/or insect repellant. Here are a few insects to be mindful of: \u2022 Biting Flies: also called \u201cdeerflies,\u201d \u201chorseflies,\u201d or \u201cMayflies.\u201d These are most active in late Spring and can last throughout the summer. \u2022 Chiggers: are small red mites.
