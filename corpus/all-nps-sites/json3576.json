{"body": "Fishing        NPS Photo/Trash Trackers   \u00a0   Lake Powell has created a new realm for anglers. Before Glen Canyon Dam was built, the Colorado River was so full of silt that only suckers, bonytails, and chubs could survive in its murky waters.  The need to protect these native endangered fish is the highest priority of the National Park Service. That does not change the fact that abundant game fish now thrive in the clear waters of Lake Powell. Introduced species such as bass and crappie as well as walleye, bluegill, and catfish challenge the avid fisherman.   \u00a0   Lake Powell Fishing    Lake Powell straddles the border of Utah and Arizona, so make sure you have a valid Utah and/or Arizona fishing license.
