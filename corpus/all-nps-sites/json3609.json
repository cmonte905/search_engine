{"body": "Audio: Wangemann\u2019s 1889-1890 European Recordings       Theo Wangemann's 1889-1890 European recordings are available below in MP3 format, listed in chronological order. For historical context and transcripts, see:   Prince Bismarck and Count Moltke Before the Recording Horn: The Edison Phonograph in Europe, 1889-1890, by Stephan Puille   [Note about sound quality: These brown wax cylinders survive in fair and poor condition. Groove surfaces are deteriorated with age, and heavily worn or damaged from historic playback. Some of the cylinders are cracked and broken with pieces missing. Sound quality of the audio is rough, due to these imperfections. Click here to read about the provenance of the cylinders. In 1889-1890, Edison had not yet standardized the phonograph's rotational speed for recording cylinders. Historic documentation of the \"RPM\" rates used by Wangemann to record these cylinders does not exist, so playback speeds are estimated here. Thanks to Ward Marston for volunteering his expertise to pitch the seven musical recordings.]  \u00a0          \"Russian Melody\" - EDIS 93954     Title: \"Russian Melody\" Performer: Tacianu Sisters - vocal quartet, a cappella Recording date: August 29, 1889 Recording location: Exposition Universelle, Paris, France Recorded by: Theo Wangemann Exhibited: September 14, 1889 at Siemens and Halske factory, Berlin, Germany Exhibited: September 23, 1889 for Emperor William II at the New Palace, Potsdam, Germany NPS catalog number: EDIS 93954  Duration:2 minutes, 41 seconds      Credit / Author: National Park Service   Date created: 2012-01-30     Download Original File: edis-01-tenhp_edison_c_E-5777_edis-93954_201104151.mp32,591 KB           \u00a0         \"Romance for Violin and Orchestra in F major\" - EDIS 93955     Title: \"Romance for Violin and Orchestra in F major\", Opus 50 by Ludwig von Beethoven Performer: Unknown.
