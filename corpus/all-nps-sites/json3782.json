I'm Ashley Guevara from Verona, Kentucky, a recent graduate from DePauw University with a Biology major. I'm super excited to work with the NPS and what's great about my internship is that I'll be involved in a variety of field projects so I'll get to experience a lot of different types of work as well as go to multiple locations within the parks.    Coal Creek Vegetation Survey Vegetation Monitoring in the Central Alaska Network  \u00a0      Greg Kinman 2013 Photo Media Intern The beauty I\u2019ve experienced in wilderness areas inspires in me a very strong reverence for the outdoors. It\u2019s very special and important to me to preserve certain areas in the same way that they have been for thousands of years so that I and others after me can enjoy seeing them in their natural state. It\u2019s also very important, especially in a place like Alaska, for practices such as subsistence hunting and \ufb01shing to be able to continue. Many remote communities depend on living off the land for food and resources, and it is important that they have that land reserved for them.
