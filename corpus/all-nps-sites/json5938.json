{"body": "Natural Resources Management         Deer herd at Monocacy National Battlefield   Natural resource management at the park focuses on projects that protect and preserve the wildlife, vegetation, trails, water, and other resources to encourage biodiversity, while helping to maintain the condition of the park\u2019s overall historic battlefield landscape. Completed Projects  Treated approximately 200 acres of invasive, exotic plants using chemical and mechanical controls. The park\u2019s Youth Conservation Corps crew also assisted with pulling approximately 5 acres of exotic garlic mustard in and around a rare native plant area.   \u00a0   Ongoing Projects  Maintain the approximately 7.5 miles of hiking and interpretive trails.  Conduct biannual spotlight counts of the park\u2019s deer population to estimate deer density.  Began initial phases of a Water Resources Stewardship Report, with the help of the Water Resources Division from the National Park Service\u2019s Washington Office. The report will help park managers with identifying, monitoring, and managing the park\u2019s significant water resources \u2013 including the river, streams, wetlands, and springs.  Continued preparing sites for, and planting, warm season grass meadows in recently converted agricultural fields on the Gambrill Farm. The meadows will provide habitat for grassland bird populations, as well as help to encourage insect and small mammal biodiversity.", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/mono/learn/management/natural-resources.htm", "title": "Monocacy National Battlefield: Natural Resources"}
