{"body": "Prescribed Fire         A fire fighter records data on weather, flame length, rate of spread, and smoke production on a prescribed fire on Mica Island in 2007.    In the places where fire can be beneficial to ecosystems or can reduce the risk of fire threatening public safety, property, or damaging natural and cultural resources, prescribed fire is one of the most important, cost effective resource management tools available. A prescribed fire may be designed to create a mosaic of diverse habitats for plants and animals, to help an endangered species recover, or to reduce fuels and prevent a destructive fire. Burning strategic areas in advance of an unwanted fire can protect specific buildings, cultural resources, critical natural resources, and habitats.   \u00a0   Monitoring   Fire monitoring plots are established within the park to monitor the health of the forest and ensure goals are met for prescribed or natural fires. Post burn information including burn severity, scorch and char height, and depth of burn, is collected in addition to vegetation and fuels data. These data are then analyzed to assess progress made toward achieving resource management objectives.  \u00a0     Plot prior to the prescribed burn.   Prescribed Burn Plot  These photographs were taken from the same location within a plot prior to burning (left) and during each re-read visit 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 15 years after the fire. Notice the progressive growth of understory vegetation, as well as the persistence of the mature red pines in the background. The site will need to be burned again to control the dense brush and allow pine to regenerate.  \u00a0    Post burn, year 0.    \u00a0    Post burn, year 1.    \u00a0    Post burn, year 2.    \u00a0    Post burn, year 5.    \u00a0    Post burn, year 10.    \u00a0    Post burn, year 15.", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/voya/learn/nature/fire-management.htm", "title": "Voyageurs National Park: Prescribed Fire"}
