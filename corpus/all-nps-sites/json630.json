The p\u016b (conch shell) is sounded to warn of thier approach, for it is forbidden for others to look upon or even cast their shadow on the ali'i (chiefs).  As the canoe makes land fall, other members of the royal court stroll past the royal fishponds, looking for a choice fish for dinner. Other chiefs may engage in a game of k\u014dnane.  The spectacular golden colors of sunset play upon the vast ocean. The beauty, splendor and history of the royal grounds at Pu'uhonua o H\u014dnaunau are still felt as you take a self-guided walking tour along the trails once reserved for Hawaiian royalty. The Royal Grounds are still considered a sacred site.  Therefore, the following restrictions are in effect.  No smoking, nudity, beach chairs, mats, towels, beach umbrellas, coolers, picnicking, weddings, pets and recreational activities are permitted.  Please help to preserve the Royal Grounds for future generations.", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/puho/planyourvisit/royalgrounds.htm", "title": "Pu`uhonua O H\u014dnaunau National Historical Park: Royal Grounds"}
