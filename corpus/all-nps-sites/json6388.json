Homesteaders in some areas were able to build log cabins like the Palmer-Epard Cabin. However, in many areas trees were not available for constructing log cabins so homesteaders lived in dugouts and sod houses. Visit the Library of Congress to learn more about dugouts and sod houses. For kids there is an interesting \"sod house\" game at this Smithsonian website.  \u00a0    Jr. Ranger Photo Upload Certificate", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/home/learn/kidsyouth/index.htm", "title": "Homestead National Monument of America: Kids & Youth"}
