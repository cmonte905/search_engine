Vicksburg National Military Park is proud of its landscape and the staff works diligently to maintain an enjoyable environment.  For the park\u2019s protection: \u2666  If hiking into the park's interior, remember, what is packed in, must be packed out. This means all waste and garbage. Please keep park sites, roads, and waterways clear of litter and refuse, as harmful substances are easily introduced into the environment and watershed through runoff.  \u2666  Even the simplest artifact tells the battlefield's story. Like lost puzzle pieces, missing or moved artifacts leave gaps in the site\u2019s history. If you find an artifact on the battlefield, please leave it alone, note its location, and tell a park ranger. Whether malicious or unintended, actions of a few individuals can cause lasting damage to park resources. \u2666  Relic hunting is prohibited. Possession or use of metal detectors, electronic detection equipment, or ground-penetrating devices is also prohibited. Park resources are protected by Federal law and severe penalties will result for any attempt to possess, disturb, or destroy them. \u2666  The park utilizes the Park Watch program.

Suspicious or hazardous situations (i.e., vandalism, relic hunting, safety violations), should be reported to a park ranger as quickly as possible, or call 911. Details (locations, descriptions of vehicles/people involved) will help park staff in their response. \u2666  Between the hours of 8:00 am and 5:00 pm, park rangers can be contacted by calling the Park Visitor Center at 601-636-0583.
