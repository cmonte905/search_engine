Attracted, like many, to the colors of the canyon and the possibility of those colors yielding gold, Dr. Barry began exploring Bighorn Canyon in the 1890s. During his exploration he happened upon the Trail Creek valley, an oasis in the desert. He never found enough gold to make himself rich, but the canyon and the surrounding environment offered all he needed to make a fortune of another kind. Dr. Barry turned to dude ranching, using the natural opportunities of hiking, fishing, hunting, camping, sight seeing, and horse back  riding. You may visit Hillsboro in the Trail Creek valley one of two ways:  The first, a one mile hike round trip, begins by driving up the red dirt road between Trail Creek campground and Barry\u2019s Landing to a closed gate. From there, a half-mile hike will take you to the abandoned site of Hillsboro. Take some time to explore the buildings and learn how the Barrys\u2019 ran the Cedarvale Dude Ranch. Don\u2019t forget to stop at the corrals below the kiosk on your way back.   The second option is a longer three mile loop hike. You may start either in the campground or at the gate, and walk to the ranch. The trail continues behind Eddy Hulbert\u2019s cabin on the historic ranch road up to the park road. Follow the road back to the Barry\u2019s Landing turn off and to where you began.   \u00a0                Hillsboro Trail   19 Photos", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/bica/planyourvisit/hillsboro-trail.htm", "title": "Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area: Hillsboro Trail"}
