Peter Hamel photo  The southern Appalachian mountains are home to more kinds of mammals than any other area of eastern North America with more than 70 species documented along the Blue Ridge Parkway. Almost every Parkway visitor will see some of the more noticeable, including white-tailed deer, gray squirrels, and the ever-present groundhog along the roadsides. The black bear is the largest mammal in these mountains and, although rarely seen by park visitors, is increasing in numbers in both Virginia and North Carolina. Beavers are also making a comeback in the region after their numbers were decimated by the fur trade in past centuries. The most opportunistic mammals-- raccoons, opossums, and skunks--are common in campgrounds and picnic areas. Other animals, such as the northern flying squirrel, are threatened or endangered. All are protected here--please observe wildlife safely and responsibly.     \u00a0   Mammal Checklist   Key to Abbreviations The following codes refer to the abundance of an animal found along the Parkway and not necessarily to the likelihood of seeing it.
