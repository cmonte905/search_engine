He was born on August 23, 1905 in Strasburg, Virginia. He was first hired in 1930 with the Bureau of Public Roads, and went on to become a noted photographer for the National Capital Parks of the National Park Service. Many of his photographs documented public buildings and roads in and around the nation's capital. In December 1941, he received an assignment. At the request of President Roosevelt, the National Park Service assigned him to provide photographic coverage of the President's activities, particularly those that occurred away from the White House. Gradually, his duties were expanded to include the documentation of events that took place within the White House. By the Truman administration, he was called upon to document the President at many official ceremonies, and his work continued through the Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson Administrations. Rowe died in April 1967.    \u00a0     Photograph shows an automobile and people standing at the overlook at Fox Hunters Paradise near mile post 218.6 in section 2A of the Blue Ridge Parkway.

In the spring of 1946, therefore, Parkway staff arranged for Rowe \u2013 still employed by the Park Service though assigned to the White House \u2013 to spend three weeks taking black and white and color pictures on the Parkway. Dates on Rowe\u2019s 200 Blue Ridge Parkway photographs, however, indicate that this may have been only the first of several trips he made to the Parkway from 1946 to 1952. While certain locations, such as Bluff\u2019s Coffee shop, Bluff\u2019s Lodge, Moses H. Cone Memorial Park, and Linville Falls, stand out as areas of focus for Rowe\u2019s Parkway visits, mileposts noted on his photographs indicate that he traversed much of the road. Rowe\u2019s often stunning Blue Ridge Parkway photographs help today\u2019s generation of Parkway travelers look through a window to the past to see how previous generations of Parkway travelers experienced the \u201cbeauty and grandeur\u201d of the Parkway. Rowe\u2019s Parkway photos range from scenic images highlighting the road\u2019s natural setting to pictures of visitor facilities and Parkway travelers enjoying the road. Reporting on Rowe\u2019s 1946 visit, Parkway Superintendent Sam Weems noted Rowe\u2019s success in capturing visitors out of their cars \u2013 a type of image he noted would be needed \u201cif we are to bring home to the motorist traveling the Parkway the fact that their trips will be the more enjoyable for having stopped off for picnic lunches and hiking in the recreation areas enroute.\u201d  In 1949, the National Park Service published the \u201cBlue Ridge Parkway, Virginia-North Carolina\u201d brochure, which featured many of Rowe\u2019s photographs.
