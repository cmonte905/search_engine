Barrier islands are narrow, low-lying, dynamic landforms which parallel ocean coasts, are separated from the mainland, and are constantly moving and reshaping in response to storms, ocean currents, sea level changes, and wave and wind action. These processes continue to influence the islands today through the processes of erosion and accretion of the shoreline; overwash across the islands; and the formation, migration, and closure of the inlets.    \u00a0        News Check out our press releases or social media sites to stay current on the happenings in the park.  \u00a0        Photos & Multimedia Experience the beauty and majesty of this special seashore.  \u00a0        History & Culture Learn more about the rich past of the Outer Banks.  \u00a0        Nature Experience the diverse barrier island ecosystems, which are influenced by the meeting of two of the Atlantic Ocean's major currents\u2014the Gulf Stream and the Labrador Current.  \u00a0        Science & Research Take a look at the important research going on all across the seashore.  \u00a0        Education Learn about the history and natural resources found within the park.  \u00a0        Kids & Youth Check out some of the activities and information tailored to our young park stewards.  \u00a0        Management Learn more about how we are managing this park to provide for visitor enjoyment while ensuring resources within the park are left unimpaired for future generations.  \u00a0        Bookstore Browse the selection of items available for purchase online through our cooperating association.", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/caha/learn/index.htm", "title": "Cape Hatteras National Seashore: Learn About the Park"}
