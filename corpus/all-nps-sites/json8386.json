{"body": "Explore This Park    Get Involved     Volunteer     Annual VIP Opportunties              Annual Volunteer Opportunities       There are several opportunities for volunteer service at Cape Lookout National Seashore. Volunteer positions vary in time from a few hours (Beaufort) to two months (Harkers Island), although most positions are for four weeks. Because of the nature of the duties and/or the remote location, two persons (couples, friends) are assigned to positions at the Light Station and in Portsmouth Village.  Individuals can apply for positions in the Cabin Camps, on Harkers Island, or in Beaufort.  Several of these positions have multi-year waiting lists, so it's best to plan ahead. Housing consists of a kitchen/dining area, sitting area, bathroom, and single bedroom with two twin beds. Mainland (days off) housing may be shared and includes laundry facilities.
