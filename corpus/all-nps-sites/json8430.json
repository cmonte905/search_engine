{"body": "Panoramas       Lighthouse Lantern Room Panorama by Dr. Laddie Crisp A panoramic view of the Cape Lookout lighthouse's lantern room is available on Dr. Laddie Crisp's Cape Lookout Panorama webpage. (Note: this link will take you away from the NPS website.) This panorama was made possible with help from the U.S. Coast Guard Sector North Carolina. Because the Cape Lookout lighthouse is still a working aide to navigation, the lantern room is closed to the public. The lighthouse up to the watch room (just below the lantern room) is open seasonally for lighthouse climbs.  \u00a0    Lighthouse Lantern Room Dr. Laddie M.
