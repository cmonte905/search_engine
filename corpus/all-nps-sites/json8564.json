You can see where to find many of these reptiles on the Species Mapper.     Turtles are strangely constructed reptiles. A turtle\u2019s body is encased in a hard shell that consists of an upper and lower half known as a carapace and plastron respectively. Turtles have no teeth. Their jaws are covered by sharp-edged, horny plates that allow the animals to shear and tear their food. Most turtles live in or near water, but lay shelled eggs on land. One of the Smokies most common species, the Eastern Box Turtle, is almost entirely terrestrial, although it may soak in a puddle on very hot days.  Eight turtle species inhabit the park: Chelydra serpentina\u2014Snapping turtle Chrysemys picta picta\u2014Eastern painted turtle Graptemys geographica\u2014Common map turtle Terrapene carolina carolina \u2014Eastern box turtle Sternotherus minor peltifer\u2014Stripeneck musk turtle Apalone spinifera spinifera\u2014Eastern spiny softshell Sternotheros odoratus\u2014Stinkpot Trachymys scripta troostiii\u2014Cumberland slider   \u00a0     Southeastern five-lined skink   Lizards have dry, scaly skins. They are active animals that use the heat of the sun to warm their bodies. The warm, dry habitats that most lizards favor occur only at fairly low elevations around the margins of the park. Most lizards have four legs and a trail, but one species that lives in the park, the Eastern Slender Glass Lizard, is legless and resembles a snake.  Nine species of lizards can be found in the park: Ophisaurus attenuatus longicaudus\u2014Eastern slender glass lizard Sceloporus undulatus hyacinthinus\u2014Northern fence lizard Anolis carolinensis carolinensis\u2014Northern green anole Eumeces anthracinus\u2014Coal skink Eumeces fasciatus\u2014Five-lined skink Eumeces inexpectatus\u2014Southeastern five-lined skink Eumeces laticeps\u2014Broadhead skink Scincella lateralis\u2014Ground skink Cnemidophorus sexlineatus sexlineatus\u2014Six-lined racerunner   \u00a0     The harmless Northern Water Snake is often mistaken for the venomous Cottonmouth - a species which is not found in the Smokies. Mike Maslona photo  The first question that most park visitors have when they see a snake is \u201cIs it poisonous?\u201d The answer is almost always \u201cno,\u201d since only 2 of the 23 species of snakes that live in the park are venomous: the Northern Copperhead and Timber Rattlesnake. The likelihood of an average visitor even seeing a venomous snake in the Great Smokies, let alone being bitten by one, is extremely small. There is no record of a human fatality due to snakebite in the park\u2019s history.  Twenty three species of snakes live in the park: Carphophis amoenus amoenus\u2014Eastern worm snake Cemophora coccinea copei\u2014Northern scarlet snake Coluber constrictor constrictor\u2014Northern black racer Diadophis punctatus edwardsii\u2014Northern ring-neck snake Elaphe guttata guttata\u2014Corn snake Elaphe obsoleta obsoleta\u2014Black rat snake Heterodon platirhinos\u2014Eastern hognose snake Lampropeltis calligaster rhombomaculata\u2014Mole kingsnake Lampropeltis getula getula\u2014Eastern kingsnake Lampropeltis getula nigra\u2014Black kingsnake Lampropeltis triangulum elapsoides\u2014Scarlet kingsnake Lampropeltis triangulum triangulum\u2014Eastern milk snake Nerodia sipedon sipedon\u2014Northern water snake Opheodrys aestivus\u2014Rough green snake Pituophis melanoleucus melanoleucus\u2014Northern pine snake Regina septemvittata\u2014Queen snake Storeria dekayi dekayi\u2014Northern brown snake Storeria dekayi wrightorum\u2014Midland brown snake Storeria occipitomaculata occipitomaculata\u2014Northern redbelly snake Tantilla coronata\u2014Southeastern crowned snake Thamnophis sirtalis sirtalis\u2014Eastern garter snake Virginia valeriae valeriae\u2014Eastern earth snake Agkistrodon Contortrix mokasen\u2014Northern copperhead (venomous) Crotalus horridus\u2014Timber rattlesnake (venomous)       \u00a0    Recommended Reading  \u00a0        Reptiles and Amphibians of the Smokies  The Smokies are the Salamander Capital of the World.
