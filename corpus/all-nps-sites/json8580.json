{"body": "Gettin' By In Winter         The John Ownby cabin on the Fighting Creek Self-Guiding Nature Trail.   What did mountain families do to get by during the long, gray days of winter? Cabin Fever The homes of mid-19th century farm families were small, while the families themselves were often large. The typical log home was 18\u2019 x 20\u2019 (360 square feet) plus, perhaps, a sleeping loft. Families were frequently multi-generational, including a grandparent and five to 12 kids. During periods of cold, snowy, or rainy weather, families were forced to spend most of the day indoors. Dorie Woodruff Cope, who spent her childhood and young adulthood in the Smokies, described winter this way: \u201cSo we waited. Snow came two or three times a week to add inches to the blanket already on the ground. Silence hung over the mountains like a misty fog.... Wind whistled around the corners of the cabin and down the chimney, causing the fire to reach out of the fireplace and fill the room with ashes. Ma kept beans and meat boiling in a kettle.\u201d  \u00a0     Fiddles and banjos were popular instruments in the mountains. NPS Archives  Making Music Mountain folk knew lots of songs and enjoyed singing ballads at home during winter, often solo and unaccompanied by musical instruments. Many of the ballads were from the British Isles and were about love or death, or religious faith. Ballads told stories and sometimes included lessons on life. Examples are \u201cThe Drunkard\u2019s Last Drink,\u201d \u201cBarbara Allen,\u201d \u201cPretty Pollie,\u201d \u201cGeordie,\u201d \u201cYoung Hunting,\u201d and \u201cBold Soldier.\u201d Some residents wrote their own ballads about local places or events, like the tragic train wreck chronicled by \u201cDaddy Bryson\u2019s Last Ride.\u201d  \u00a0   Winter Fare Mid-1800s Smoky Mountain winter fare was somewhat lacking in fresh produce, but few complained: it was a whole lot better than having nothing to eat. If the crops had been good, the livestock prolific, and the jobs of pickling, drying, salting, and sulfuring productive, the typical menu might include:    \u2022 lots of corn bread \u2022 salted pork \u2022 dried green beans \u2022 pickled vegetables \u2022 chicken \u2022 potatoes \u2022 chestnuts   \u2022 butter \u2022 stack cake \u2022 sulfured apples \u2022 honey \u2022 sorghum molasses \u2022 squirrel \u2022 corn mush      Lessons Learned Winter days were often school days in the Great Smoky Mountains of the mid-1800s. Winter was when children were needed the least on the farm, so it was the logical time to hit the books. In the early days, the school year lasted only 2-4 months. Parents paid about $1 per student per month to get their children educated. The money (or produce in lieu of cash) went to a teacher who often boarded with a local family. Most students completed only 3-5 years of schooling, enough to learn to read and write and perform basic mathematics. By the early 20th century, however, Smoky Mountain schools and school years more closely resembled today\u2019s. Two country schools are preserved in the national park. Little Greenbrier School is accessible in winter by the 0.7 mile Metcalf Bottoms Trail which begins at Metcalf Bottoms Picnic Area. Beech Grove School is beside the road in Cataloochee Valley  \u00a0     Caroline Walker Shelton poses with her children in front of a quilt she made. NPS Archives  A Stitch in Time Mountain quilts were often both useful and beautiful. The top layer was usually made from leftover scraps of cloth, worn out clothing, and cloth sacks. The middle was stuffed with pieces of old clothing, old quilts, feed sacks, or sheep\u2019s wool, and the bottom was simply whatever other plain material was available. Popular patterns in the southern Appalachians were Log Cabin, Blazing Star, Double Wedding Ring, and improvised \u201ccrazy quilts.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/grsm/learn/historyculture/winter-stories.htm", "title": "Great Smoky Mountains National Park: Getting By In Winter"}
