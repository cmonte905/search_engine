{"body": "Product Standardization         Maintenance Building at Pictured Rocks NL NPS photo  Paints and Coatings  The lakeshore developed a written Paints and Coatings Standard with these goals.  1.  Maximize cost effectiveness of Lakeshore painting activities. 2.  Reduce inventory of products and associated wastes. 3.  Assure paint color uniformity throughout the Lakeshore and provide standard identification for visitors. The benefit and effectiveness of the program have been realized in several ways.   \u00b7  Quick determination of products/colors used for various painting activities. \u00b7  Allow for spot repair instead of whole item repainting. \u00b7  Assist procurement actions through the use of identified manufacturers. \u00b7  Reduce the number and variety of hazardous products in use. \u00b7  Reduce time and effort in hazardous materials inventory and Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) information updating. \u00b7  Minimize product waste and waste disposal.   During the implementation of this program, employees were encouraged to use up the existing inventory of \"non-standard\" items to reduce waste and disposal costs. Most of the remaining materials were donated to local social services agencies for community services projects.  \u00a0   For more information ...  please visit our Green Resources page.
