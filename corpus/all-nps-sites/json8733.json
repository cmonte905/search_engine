Opportunities for recycling are offered in the lakeshore's campgrounds, visitor centers, and offices. The Lakeshore recycles about 5000 pounds of office paper each year, along with smaller amounts of aluminum, scrap metal, and tires.  \u00a0     Custodian's cleaning cart with non-toxic products NPS photo  Reduced Toxins Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore employees have switched to alternative safer green products, replacing the more toxic or harmful items they once used. Supervisors were tasked with reducing toxins in their work places by 10% each year, a goal that was included in their annual performance standards.   This project has been especially effective with cleaning products and auto shop solvents. It has led to almost exclusive use of biodegradable \"green\" cleaning products, reducing petroleum based solvent use, and a continuing growing variety of \"greener\" products now used in the workplace.  \u00a0   Green Procurement Opportunities are continually explored to bring green products and processes into the Lakeshore and its workplaces.  Examples of these include:   \u00b7  four cycle snow machines and boat engines. \u00b7  non-mercury containing fluorescent tubes. \u00b7  non-hazardous treated woods. \u00b7  re-refined motor oil. \u00b7  remanufactured printer toner cartridges. \u00b7  paper products with 100% recycled content (toilet paper, paper towels, and office copy paper).   \u00a0   Vehicle Fleet Downsizing  Selection of replacement vehicles is based on the smallest vehicle that will serve its primary purpose. Five vehicles have been downsized in the last eight years.  \u00a0   For more information ...  please visit our Green Resources page.
