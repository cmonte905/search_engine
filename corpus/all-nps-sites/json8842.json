Along its 42 miles of Lake Superior shoreline are over 15 miles of towering sandstone cliffs, more than 12 miles of beautiful beaches, and nearly five miles of enormous sand dunes. And there are waterfalls, lighthouses, lakes, streams, and forest to enjoy.  Many attractions are accessible either by automobile or by short footpaths. Hikes can be as short as 100 feet or as long as nine miles. Only your enthusiasm and energy will limit your distance.    \u00a0        Visitor Centers Passport Stamps   \u00a0        Maritime Sites    \u00a0        Scenic Sites    \u00a0        Waterfalls    \u00a0        Beaver Basin Wilderness   \u00a0        Drive-in Campgrounds    \u00a0   Return to top of page", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/piro/planyourvisit/placestogo.htm", "title": "Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore: Places To Go"}
