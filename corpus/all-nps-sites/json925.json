Founded on August 1, 1916, the park was the 15th national park, predating both the establishment of the National Park Service itself (August 25, 1916) and Hawaiian statehood (August 21, 1959). From New Year's Day 2016 through December 31, 2016, Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park will celebrate our 100th anniversary, and we invite everyone to join us! Some of our exciting plans to commemorate a century of stewardship include a Centennial Hike series and corresponding After Dark in the Park programs; the annual Hawaiian Cultural Festival & BioBlitz; parade participation; a national parks quilt show; and much more. Whether you're a repeat visitor, a national park traveler, or a virtual adventurer, Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park hopes that our 100th anniversary will inspire you to experience this park and connect with the fascinating geology, biology and culture that we strive to protect and perpetuate well into the next 100 years.  \u00a0   Hawai\u2018i Volcanoes National Park Centennial Events for August 2016  \u00a0   Celebrate the 100th Anniversary of the National Park Service with a Fee-Free Weekend of Hawaiian Music, Culture & Science  \u00a0   Centennial Series Schedule for 2016 After Dark in the Park Programs & Hikes   \u00a0      Find Your Park on the Big Screen Hawai\u2018i Volcanoes National Park is showing sister park movies for free to raise awareness of the other national parks in Hawai\u2018i and the Pacific Islands during its centennial year.

In the center, Halema\u2018uma\u2018u Crater erupts on K\u012blauea Volcano under a starry night sky. The ongoing eruption is characterized by a glowing lava lake and a dramatic plume of gas and ash wafting skyward. Massive, active volcano Mauna Loa, sometimes capped in snow during winter months, stands above the erupting crater, a scene visitors can see from the Keanakako\u2018i side of Halema\u2018uma\u2018u. A n\u0113n\u0113, the endemic and federally endangered Hawaiian goose, is seen in flight and is a reminder of the success of the park's n\u0113n\u0113 recovery efforts. On the right \"hip,\" a Hawaiian petroglyph is reminiscent of an actual petroglyph found at Pu\u2018uloa in the park, the largest concentration of petroglyphs in the Hawaiian islands. On the left hip, the red bloom of the \u2018\u014dhi\u2018a lehua symbolizes both the importance of the native \u2018\u014dhi\u2018a tree found throughout the park, and its significance of a sacred flower of Pele. The stars represent the beautiful night sky that visitors can experience while in the park after dark.  We are proud of our Centennial logo! If you are interested in using it, please contact the park's Centennial Coordinator at (808) 985-6018, or via email. An array of Centennial merchandise is available throughout the park.", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/havo/getinvolved/100th-anniversary.htm", "title": "Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park: 100th Anniversary of Hawai\u2018i Volcanoes National Park"}
