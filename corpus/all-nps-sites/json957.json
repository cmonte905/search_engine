Congratulations Kate!My Hawai'i, is an annual environmental writing contest for middle school students in Grades 6, 7 and 8 from across the state. The top 25 poems and short stories were selected from more than 360 submissions and will be published in an anthology that is distributed to schools and libraries statewide. The students' writing represents personal reflections on the environment, cultural values, kuleana, stewardship, and place-based writing, and contributes to a collection of youth literature that is unique to Hawai'i. To date, 225 middle school students have had their stories and poems on the environment published! While academic testing provides a measure of content knowledge, creative writing can capture students' thoughts, passions, beliefs, and values.The My Hawai'i Story Contest provides an educational approach that develops interdisciplinary thinkers. Many of the stories and poems include knowledge from diverse backgrounds and provide good examples of successful collaborations that integrate traditional cultural values and contemporary life in Hawai'i. The imaginative visions of middle school students reveal their insights on Hawaii's environment today and their dreams for tomorrow. The future of conservation and environmental leadership lies firmly in the hands our haumana, the young people of Hawai'i. This important initiative encourages, nurtures, cultivates, and promotes future generations to develop a sense of responsibility to care for and protect Hawaii's environment.For the past nine years the Pacific Writers' Connection (PWC), the Hawai'i Conservation Alliance, and the following state and federal agencies, have co-sponsored the My Hawai'i Story Contest:Hawai'i Coastal Zone Management ProgramHawai'i Conservation AllianceHawai'i Conservation Alliance FoundationHawai'i Department of EducationHawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources - Division of Forestry and Wildlife and Division of Aquatic ResourcesHawai'i Environmental Education AllianceNational Park Service - Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park and Friends of Hawai'i Volcanoes National ParkNational Oceanic and Atmospheric AdministrationPapah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National MonumentFor more information, please contact Dr. Takiora Ingram, cell: 808-781-6147 or email tingram.raro@gmail.com or Molly Mamaril, email mamaril@hawaii.edu", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/havo/learn/kidsyouth/2015_my_hawaii.htm", "title": "Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park: My Hawai\u2018i Story Contest 2015"}
